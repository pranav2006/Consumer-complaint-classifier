"This bank has consistantly manipulated my direct deposits in order to charge fees. I have an online XXXX shop with direct deposits which can have deposits one to five times a week depending on sales. All deposits are submitted to bank between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and I am sent an email stating funds have been sent to bank in addition to the money shown on the funding page of my site showing when they remove from my shop account and send to bank. 
When I have suffecient funds already in bank, when there would be no way to manipulate deposits and charges, checks etc Chase will deposit these direct deposits prior to any other charges EVERY TIME My bank history shows this to be consistant but when I am going to be short for a charge if the deposit is not deposited first THEY HAVE BEEN CONSISTANTLY CHARGING ME FOR ANY CHECKS OR WITHDRAWLS PRIOR TO MY DIRECT DEPOSIT. And ONLY when they can be sure to charge me a fee if they do not deposit first. Case in point is a fee I acquired on XX/XX/2019. I had apx {$95.00} available that morning. I got my confirmation from my XXXX account that funds where sent to bank at XXXX XXXXm. I had a check written to the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for utilities for {$120.00} in which I know was not deposited until after XXXX to our town of apx 300 people at the small local bank. 
I check at apx XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX and there is no withdrawl but the deposit was shown as pending. I check again at apx XXXX this XXXX and Chase has taken the check and processed it first and the direct deposit after!! AGAIN!! But both where showing as processed. I once again, I have to do this time to time I live on SSI and my income is low and so I live hand to mouth and pray I sell something on XXXX to eat all month. I wrote them and told them to STOP CHEATING ME and manipulating. The refused to refund charge. In addition they have now moved the direct deposit not only behind check and the service fee of {$34.00} but it is now showing as pending again along with another direct deposit that was processed on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX : XXXX But I can go back, month after month, for two years and every time I have sufficient funds and there is no way to charge me a fee, my direct deposits from XXXX are processed prior to any other charges!!! 
This is something Chase was sued for. It is unethical and maybe not illegal maybe it is. They should not have the ability to process a deposit however they want, when they want in order to charge fees. If they deposit the direct deposit prior to charges 99 percent of time but yet don't only if they can XXXX me that is deceptive practice. I should be able to count on the fact that my direct deposits will ALWAYS BE DEPOSITED THE SAME WHICH IS PRIOR TO CHARGES not be screwed by this corrupt institution. 
I want my fee returned and I want this bank to be told they can not do whatever the XXXX they want when they want to XXXX consumers. 
I have been getting these direct deposits over 2-3 yrs now on a weekly if not daily basis. This account is established and there is no reason for them to pend the amount only in order to charge a fee but not to pend it when they can not. 
Please help. 
I have over a thousand emails showing when my direct deposits are sent to bank but I don't know how to upload and save these or to attach them below. I am in my mid 60s and not very literate on computers or social media etc. I also have years worth of bank  statements online or daily records for at least several months in which you can see that when I have funds available and that there would be no way to XXXX a fee from me, they have ALWAYS deposited the XXXX direct prior to charges and that the only time this is not done is when I am short a few dollars here or there and depend on my direct deposit to be processed as it is all the other times, first before withdrawls. yet they don't and charge me fees.

"Hello, This email is in reference to the fraud department at Wells Fargo Bank committing fraud. I transferred {$4700.00} in funds from my WF savings to my WF checking account online with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2016, which made my balance a total of {$4700.00}. I received word from WF asking if I made this transfer of funds. I confirmed the transfer was legitimate and I in fact made the transfer. I then wrote a check in the amount of {$3800.00}. When the check came through my checking account I received word from Wells Fargo Fraud Dept that there was a check that came through and asked if I wrote the check. I confirmed the check was legitimate and that I had written the check. I confirmed all security information once again. Even though I cleared their suspicions, the fraud department never lifted the hold on my checking account and then charged me {$35.00} in NSF charges. I called the bank to clear up the issue and asked that they refund the {$35.00} in NSF charges and clear the check. They assured me the hold was lifted and that they would refund me the NSF charges. They suggested the person I wrote the check to put the check back through my account, so they did so. Wells Fargo Fraud department still had a hold on my account AND charged me ANOTHER {$35.00} for NSF. I was unable to obtain my funds that I very much needed at the time! I do not have a WF branch in the state that I moved to but luckily I was on vacation and happened to stop by a WF branch to withdraw the money in person that I owed to the person that I wrote the check to previously -- had n't I done that I still would not be able to access my funds. I then called the WF Fraud department back today asking them to refund the XXXX NSF charges and was informed that I was only going to be refunded {$17.00} for one of them as a "" courtesy. '' They explained that when the check came through the transfer of the funds from my savings account to my checking account "" had n't yet cleared '' ( BECAUSE THEY HAD THE HOLD ON MY CHECKING ACCOUNT THINKING THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS FROM SAVINGS WAS FRAUDULANT ) and that was the reason for the NSF charge. I was never told this the 2 other times I called about the NSF charges, nor when I stopped by the branch -- they always agreed the charges were in error and agreed to credit my account. When you make a funds transfer from savings to checking, there is NO WHERE on the website that states the funds will not be available for any period of time. In fact, it states they are available immediately, as reflected in the balance. Today I transferred more funds from my savings to my checking account just to see if the system would state that the funds would take time to become available and it did not. The system stated that the funds were AVAILABLE under "" available balance. '' I will attach all proof.

"Checking account # XXXX This is with old account I had and change the account to a new account. This account was no longer active. However, a few days agao my son transfer money from his account to my account. Not knowing, the account was old and inactive account. However, Bank Of America, still allow the transaction to go and took the money to pay over draft fees. My son was not aware this was a inactive account, and sent money in there. To pay a bill on his behalf. When I went to look for the money he transfer me, this is when I learn, the money was transfer to the wrong account. If this account was no longer active, how could bank of america except the money? Then take money to pay off fees, I was not aware about any fees. Because I never receive a letter. How was fees still being charge, if the account was no longer active. It looks like BOA was charing me overdraft fees. on account that was no longer active. Because I open a new cheacking account, due to fraud on this old accout. I feel BOA looks for everyway to rip off custmers to collect fees unfairly. Please read what happens with the fees, they charge on letter below that explains everything. 

Now on this account that I had in the past. I and my wife sign up for overdraft protection with Bank of America awhile back.My account is link to online backing and mobile, to receive alerts for our account. However, when account goes low it does show up right away. The amount I see available at that time does not reflect to what I really have. It takes 24 hours, or even longer on the weekends for the real amount to show. So I am unaware of the true balance of my account due to the delays. If this a weekend, I will not know my true available funds until late Monday. By that time I was charge multiple overdraft fees. Bank of American also holds on to transaction for few days, before you see it as a alert. So the balance is never accurate at time you are reviewing your account, it takes days for it to reflect. Even if you call them, the bank will say to have but so much in the account however, it not true. Due to the fact they did not account for all transactions going on. 

Its allow me to take money out I do not have and/or allow transactions to be process, charging overdraft without me knowing the real balance and charging me overdraft fees. Bank of America unfairly assessed and collected. I was charge overdraft fees on debit card transactions, because Bank of America allow the transaction to be process, instead of declining the transaction due to not enought funds in the account. Furthermore, for example, weeks ago Bank of America allow me to withdraw money from my account, knowing I did not have the funds in the account and then turn around and charge me overdraft fees. They authorized and approved when there was insufficient funds available. How can the approve that when the funds are not there to cover the cost. It appears its the banks way in making money. I should be getting alerts on my phone to let me know when my balance is low and no funds available. However, I never receive those alerts on my cell. BOA fails to reject debit card purchases if there is n't enough money in my account. Then later on I am stuck overdraft charges. Without the alerts. I am unaware of what is going on with my account. When I learn something is wrong it 's too late, BOA charge me overdraft fees in the hundreds per month. I do not know about the overdraft fees until I receive a post card in the mail letting me know.

I asked about any fees with that the currency transaction and they said "" no ''.

I tried multiple times to return the money as I was misled and they said they could not do that. I feel that this was a very misleading practice from chase - saying there was no fee when there really was in the form of a lower rate. I was going to let that go ( obviously I did not file anything with the cfpb ; I did complain to chase and they did nothing ) but recently there was another troubling issue so I thought I would it add it as well. the most recent issue occurred in the last couple of months. all of sudden the address on my account changed - to an address I used over 10 years ago! ( and to add ... I had closed all my account back then and left chase when I moved away - then when I moved back I opened a new account about 3 years ago. ) I found out when I went in the local branch and they asked me to verify my address. I gave them my current address and the one before that and they said both were wrong. finally they told what address was in there and I was very perplexed as to how that could happen - that a 10 year old address would be there. they said they would look into it and email me ( they wrote down my email ) or call me. I never heard a word form them ( including the manager who was there and said she would handle it ) so i wrote to chase online to try to get answers. so, I have asked about it and no one will give me an answer. when I sent an on line message to get answers they say they will only call - not document anything - and they said they tried to call me but said the number they tried was no longer in service. I checked my chase profile and my correct phone number is in there. anyway, I am very concerned that they would just change my address for no reason on an old account - what else could be changed that I am unaware of?? the old address was also used by my ex wife so i 'm not sure if she had access to any of my acocunt. it 's very scary and upsetting.

So I asked if it would be an issue if I would consider friends because my drivers license name and my married name for XXXX different names would that be an issue he said it should n't be. Then I asked if I could get a card from the branch he told me no and that was a lie because some branches can give cards and XXXX did @ XXXX.

So all in all the lack of correct information given to me by severely employee 's of PNC not only caused me not to have access to my money but also caused me unpleasant illness.

My daily morning routine has been to check my account balance online and to ensure if funds have been made available and also to check if my issued checks have been cleared. 
On XX/XX/XXXX morning when I checked my balance I had {$16000.00} and the funds were fully available. That afternoon when I went at the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX to make a wire transfer of {$9300.00} to my vendor overseas who supplies me with merchandise, I was informed by the banker that I did not have enough funds in my account to proceed with this activity as a domestic wire of $ XXXX was sent this afternoon. 
I was shocked and concerned at the same time and requested the banker to call the wire department to stop the wire as I had no knowledge of this and I did not authorize or make a request online to transfer funds anywhere. I have NEVER sent a wire ONLINE ever with Santander and have always gone to the branch to send a wire. This bank is right opposite my office building in garment district and all the bankers in that branch know me and also know that I have always been there to do a wire.

Today I am writing to you to ask for your help in getting this matter resolved. I am a small business owner and can not afford to have funds missing from my account. 
This thought is frightening to me that a bank which is considered a safe institution can easily be hacked/fooled in removing funds from your clients account. 
How does something like this happen at a bank? There has to be some sort of verification that has to take place before releasing funds from someones account. 
It was implied that my PC was hacked and that is where all this began. I have a PC with built in firewall and security and I check my business account, my personal account, my kids account my credit cards all from there. There was no problem anywhere except with Santander. 
I am beyond frustrated at this point as I am only getting a run around from all of this. I requested the bank to give me credit for the missing funds so I am not forced out of business and that too never came through. 
Please look into this matter urgently. I am hopeful now that I am reaching out to you all to look into this for me and help get this resolved as soon as possible.

I disputed this account directly with US Bank and with XXXX. US Bank has gone to great lengths to keep me from being able to dispute this account and has continued to toe the line in breaking the law set forth in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Let this complaint serve as official notice to US Bank that any communication moving forward will be through the CFPB so that they are held accountable by the CFPB. US Bank forced me to take off work and fill out the form even though I have filled out the official FTC Identity theft affidavit and presented it to US Bank through my XXXX dispute. US Bank has been the only financial institution that has refused to validate my claim of identity theft with the bank responsible for the identity theft.

I am also attaching a letter from another creditor who also investigated my claim and deleted their negative reporting.

"Despite my efforts to keep a substantial amount of available funds in my checking account on a daily basis, TD Bank continues to implement different techniques from within their policies and procedures to justify the overdraft fees being charged to my account.

They have designed overdraft policies that allow for them to charge {$35.00} on checking accounts with sufficient balances. Attached is a record of my transaction history which proves that my account balance has always been sufficient when the fees were charged.

"To Whom it May Concern, I was charged {$12.00} for insufficient funds on a check that I tried to deposit to my account. Prior to writing the check, the checkwriter checked her account to make sure she had sufficient funds. After depositing the check, I received the notice that I was being charged. 

I tried to call Customer Service to ask why it is Wells Fargo 's policy to charge its customers for something which is not within their control. A company which claims to "" proactively protect our customers ' financial security through a risk focused culture '' should not impose fees upon its patrons which they have no control over. This alienates those risk-averse people who do everything they can to be prudent in their financial decisions and do their due diligence because it imposes upon them a risk they can not obviate. 
I have been a Wells Fargo Customer for a decade. I hold checking and savings account. I have a safety deposit box. I have a credit card. And as a student in professional school, I planned to patronize the bank for years to come. My experience with the Customer Service phone team has made me question these plans. 

Upset over this fee, I called Customer Service to request a refund. I asked my customer service representative how any customer could avoid these fees in the future. She had no answer for me. I asked her if that means I should just avoid using Wells Fargo financial services in the future, and she essentially agreed that this was the only way for me to minimize my risk. 
A business that claims protect its customers ' financial security while imposing undue fees on them ( that a prudent customer could not possibly control ) is not conducive to customer retention or satisfaction. How could I possibly feel that my money is secure if I can not protect myself from arbitrary fees? 

The worst part of the entire experience is that the supervisor who I spoke to pretended that she did not hear me and hung up as I was trying to explain the situation. Luckily, I recorded the whole ordeal. 

What I would like to know is exactly how Wells Fargo would advise me to avoid such charges in the future? Is there some magical database I can access to ensure that a check that I receive will have sufficient funds in the future? Or should I stop using Wells Fargo services in general?

"I had an Opportunity checking account with Wells Fargo that required one year of keeping an account in good standing -meaning it was to be an actively used account in order to have upgraded features after 1 year, such as ability for outside atm deposits, larger amount withdrawls, higher daily spending limit etc,. The account did not include any monthly service fees for having a direct deposit each month. 
At the one year mark around XXXX 2016 I visited the branch due to deposit issues and a misplaced direct deposited check from SSI which was somehow routed into a closed account ( i believe which was previously suspected to be compromised when charges I did not authorize began to occur ) My direct deposit was ultimately located but once that was resolved I also began to see monthly service charges that were not agreed upon, with the switch to a new and secured account, I was then not allowed the new account features as agreed upon. Staff stated my account had not been open a year, then once I escalated the concern to show what occurred, they then stated it was not in good standing due to overdraft charges ... but the overdraft charges were due to debit transactions that had been processing out of sequence or very delayed ( even though I tracked and managed my spending not to mention had been complimented by Bank teller employees about the good standing and mngmt of my account ) yet resulted in multiple overdraft fees mostly for reasons I could not decypher or was able to predict. Also, I was unable to process my car payment due to continued limits on my account ; the amount was declined to process on time resulting in fees to my lending company, so I immediately closed the account because of nit being able to have access to my own money in order to pay bills and the fact that Management refused to fully refund my money for their transaction processing errors resulting in multiple over draft fees. They would only agree to proving me with a portion of the costs despite lengthy conversations by phone, I was then instructed to just go into the branch and handle it with management. There was an issue with my car payment which actually DID then process after my account closure! & Fees added after the fact..I had to dispute this because it resukted in a dual car payment to my lender. I was refunded the money for this but would appreciate it being looked into further since it seems very unethical and I have not heard anything from Wells Fargo since.",Checking or savings account or service,0,1

"See attached copy of letter to Santander Bank CEO & President XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Below is an excerpt of the letter : - XXXX XXXX, 2016 Sent by Fax # XXXX and First Class Mail XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CEO and President Santander Bank, N. A. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX : Re : Checking Account Number XXXX Earlier this year, I was solicited by Santander Bank, N.A. to open a checking account with {$150.00} Bonus. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I opened the account with XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX, PA XXXX Branch of Santander Bank. 

By deception, XXXX XXXX failed to offer or order an ATM/Debit card for the subject checking account, expecting that Santander Bank will impose fees on this account. 
I had to call Santander Customer Service three times before I received an ATM/Debit card and this caused more inconvenience to me. I am told that some Santander Bank employees engage in such deception to increase fees revenues. 

XXXX XXXX told me that any direct deposit of {$500.00} or more from any business entity made within 90 days of the subject checking account will qualify for {$150.00} Bonus. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, a business entity XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX made a direct deposit payment of {$530.00} to the above captioned account fully complying with the {$150.00} Bonus offer that Santander Bank, N.A. made online to solicit checking account customers. 

According to the terms and conditions of the {$150.00} Bonus offer ( copy attached ), it specifically states : - Direct deposits include deposits made by your employer or a federal or state government agency or retirement benefits administrator and generally payments made by corporations or other organizations. It does not include deposits to your Account that are made by an individual using online banking or an Internet payment provider such as XXXX. 

The direct deposit of {$530.00} was made by a business entity, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It certainly was NOT made by an individual. See attached Bank Statement. 

The Santander Bank, XXXX PA XXXX Branch Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX was contacted about this matter and he chose to make misrepresentations about qualifying for the {$150.00} Bonus. He stated that the direct deposit must be from a payroll company like XXXX or XXXX which is grossly false and that kind of condition was never disclosed when the subject account was opened. 

Nowhere in the Terms and Conditions shown above ( copy attached ) does it state a requirement for Direct Deposit to be made exclusively by XXXX or XXXX. This same excuse of Direct Deposit has to be made by a payroll company ( XXXX or XXXX ) was repeated by the Santander Bank Customer Service call center Staff. It is evident that the systemic problem of deceptively soliciting new checking account customers with {$150.00} bonus is further compounded by Santander Employees being trained to mislead the customers that they are not entitled to the {$150.00} bonus unless XXXX or XXXX ( exclusively ) provides the direct deposit of {$500.00} or more. 

See attached copy of email sent by the owner and founder of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Santander Bank Branch Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX who chose to ignore and refused to respond to several reminders/calls about the lapses. 

As one of the many customers who was solicited and deceived by Santander Bank, I am writing to you XXXX XXXX as the CEO and President of the bank, to get assurance that {$150.00} Bonus owed to me will be credited on the subject account immediately. Despite my repeated requests, this matter has not been corrected. I would greatly appreciate your looking into this matter immediately and straightening it out. 

If Santander Bank fails to credit {$150.00} Bonus to the subject checking account, please close this account immediately and mail the check to my address shown above without any further delays.",Checking or savings account or service,0,0

"Abuse # 1 ) Every year for the past several years we have had to contact BofA and request that transactions never be paid for our debit card if there are insufficient funds in the account. And every year Bank of America resets our debit card so transactions will be paid regardless of balance and a {$35.00} fee charged. 

It is a violation of both federal and state law for Bank of American to alter a customer account in this way, against the customer 's continued requests not to, just to continually perpetuate the scam of {$35.00} transaction fees. 

Abuse # 2 Further, we receive an email immediately after the {$35.00} dollar fee is charged. An honest bank would send an email immediately but before charging {$35.00} stating there are insufficient funds should a customer want those transactions paid ( we do n't but other customers may ), in which case one could have the option of using another debit card or transferring funds immediately to BofA. Transferring money between accounts is instant and free and easy online or via an APP. This kind of abusive behavior by any bank, especially a national bank such as Bank of America, is absolutely inexcusable.

"I contacted PNC bank on XXXX/XXXX/17 around XXXX XXXX CST, in order to attempt to enroll in XXXX XXXX. I had just purchased a new phone and wanted to transfer over my banking information to my new phone which should have been an easy process. Out of all the accounts I am a cardholder of, PNC was the only one which required a phone call. It should not have been a big deal and I have no difficulty calling, however the blatant disrespect received by me due to the action of PNC was appalling.
The first person I spoke with asked for my SSN and a recent deposit into my account. Since my phone was new as I stated above, my PNC app was locked out. She advised me to call back, which I understood.
The next time I called back the woman I spoke with was extremely rude and asked me for my SSN again, and told me she would not assist me until I stepped into a branch. I asked multiple times for additional information or assistance, and she outright told me she would not help me. She told me she was going to be placing me on hold and when I asked why, she ignored me and went ahead with the hold. Five minutes later, she came back and said there was a problem with the phone. Over and over I asked where are you sending me and what is happening, but she ignored me and placed me on hold in the middle of our conversation. She also continuously referred to me as ma'am even clearly stating she thought I as a woman, which I am clearly not.
The next person I spoke with asked for my SSN, DOB, and my drivers license number before telling me to enter a branch. I continued to ask why, and was told he would not be assisting me. When I asked for information to track our conversation such as a name or ID, the Specialist refused and told me he would not speak to me further.
The "" Supervisor '' I spoke with asked me roughly the same questions for the 3rd or fourth time now, and then said he did not have any other questions. He promised he would "" warm transfer '' me to a Specialist. I waited on hold for 11 minutes, before the Specialist came on the line who had no idea who I was or what was happening. He did n't even tell her the issue or what was done because I still had to give my SSN and all my information again.
PNC bank has shown horrendously poor Customer service, and has discriminated against me based on my potential orientation and/or my gender. I have been a Customer for a few years now, and this is not acceptable.

"I requested on XX/XX/XXXX for my account to be closed via secured messaging. I was told I had to call the bank customer service. I did that and was told the account would be closed. I log into the account a few days later and see transaction activity in the account and where Chase has reversed some credits without my knowledge causing the account to go into a negative balance position. So I immediately called to see what happened to the account since there was no activity initiated by me that would cause this to happen. I made arrangements to remove all excess funds from the account so it will be XXXX for the closure. So I was told that Chase allowed another bank XXXX  post credits to my account after I'd already reported them for fraudulently activity closing out my debit card and everything so when they allowed the XXXX  to reverse their two debits to my account Chase then reversed their credit to my account which caused all of this confusion. So I called Chase Bank customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and informed them that I will fund the account in the amount of {$50.00} to bring the account to XXXX so my request to have the checking account can finally be closed. The transaction number # XXXX shows the transfer initiated onXX/XX/XXXX and completed successfully XX/XX/XXXX but for some strange reason Chase is not reflecting this balance in my account on XX/XX/XXXX or today XX/XX/XXXXbut it allowed a random deposit be posted to my account for {$8.00} be posted to my account now bringing the balance to $ XXXX. Now in meantime I'm calling customer service and not one representative can explain to me why this has happened and I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that only one person in Chase Bank - XXXX XXXX at XXXX ext. XXXX  can explain why my transfer is not showing up and why the account has been closed yet as requested. I found this incredible to believe and requested to speak to a supervisor and she took my internal complaint and reiterated that someone I've never had contact with before is the only person that can explain why my account is still open with selective transactions being posted to it.

So onXX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX 4 times starting with XXXX CST because on XX/XX/XXXX I was told she was on pacific time. I left about 3 voicemail messages and no response. So I called customer service at General inquiry XXXX yet again and explained the entire dramatic account of what I've endured to get this account closed and once again the customer service rep had no answers for me but he did acknowledge that it made no sense for the account to be open still and he also informed me that my transfer deposit of {$50.00} was rejected. Now I'm not sure why that would be if the account was made to go negative after my request to close it but Chase rejects a deposit to bring the account to XXXX.

This appears as a long drawn out attempt to keep me as a customer but I'm not interested in playing any games with Chase and I want them to honor my request to close this account and accept the deposit that was completed per their records so we can end this business relationship once and for all.

I've also noted that none of these customer reps give their name, number or email address to follow up on the claims made during the recorded calls. I have each and every secured email message and I have a screen shot of the completed transfer and the balance on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

Excerpt from secured email messages : "" - If your account balance is negative, please make a deposit or transfer to bring your balance to XXXX as soon as you can. "" - I did this but Chase has taken not processed transfer to my balance.

"" - You can continue to make deposits and transfers into your account at the ATM, online, by phone, or at any of our branches.

I asked them to please document every phone call and to please put notes on the account regarding this issue with fraud. I filed a dispute on all charges made in Flordia. The credit card company approved the charges on the card ending in XXXX but did not approve the other charges on card ending in XXXX. Every time I called customer service they said the fraud department handles these issues and they could not resolve that issue. ""you have to email them"" I tried calling a number XXXX for two weeks no one ever answers that line. So I continue to email that department. The last response from them was that I check off the lost/stolen box on the form and because I check that box off the transaction were not fraudulent or counterfeit. I let them know that it was a mistake and that I had written an explanation in the box provide a detail about what had occurred. This department is not looking at the full details of this case. They are going about it based on a check mark on their form. That was checked and followed by an explanation as well. I have sent several emails with documentation and proof of everything that I have now two months later they are asking for the physical card to be returned that is they are not returned the charger will not be removed. I did everything that was in my power to notify them and explain what was happen we responded no to these charges and their company put a block as well.

My complaint is that this is an unfair and deceptive practice. From the customer 's vantage point, points are accrued when one flies ( i.e. the flight dates ) and when one pays their credit card - it is unreasonable to expect that the layperson would know that there is a material lag between payment and posting dates which, in this case ( and probably many others ), could result in failure to obtain a marketed benefit with material monetary value.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,0

My ex-wife has stated to American Express that she will pay the charges. American Express has not collected from my ex-wife and is trying to collect from me even though they are not my charges and American Express has all the information needed to contact my ex-wife.

The representative I spoke with deflected stating that even though American Express lost the payment, my concern should be with the XX/XX/XXXX payment that was now due. I asked the representative how or even why I should be responsible for a XX/XX/XXXX payment, if the bank had already lost my XX/XX/XXXX payment had had not offered to compensate me for the two-thousand dollar loss. It took two additional representatives, all of whom were based in XXXX, to even offer to file an investigation regarding the lost XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

Once I was satisfied that the lost payment was being investigated I remitted the XX/XX/XXXX payment this took place around XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX. Shortly thereafter, the lost XX/XX/XXXX payment was found but applied retroactively with a data of XX/XX/XXXX, instead of the XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I paid an additional XXXX dollars to cover the XX/XX/XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid an additional XXXX dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid an additional XXXX dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid an additional XXXX dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid an additional XXXX dollars. Over the sum total of the payments made to my American Express account totaled around XXXX dollars, which was in excess of my minimum payment obligations including both my pay over time and charge balance from the period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. Yet American Express marked my payments since XX/XX/XXXX as Late. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX American express contacted me indicating that a XX/XX/XXXX payment had been returned and as such my account was under Financial Review. I asked the representative what the impact of the review might be and he stated it could be a downgrade in risk exposure ( line of credit ) and or a cancellation of the card. My risk exposure limit was reduced after the financial review, after Id made a XXXX dollar payment. In this instance the risk exposure limit was lowered beyond the current balance of the card, making the card unusable until I made a subsequent payment. American Express subsequently canceled not only the card referenced here, but my additional elite status card a week later. 

According to American Express own analytics, my monthly spending for the period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX was below the level over the previous year. In fact, it was only around half of the previous year. Furthermore, my six month statement balance was reduced over a six-month period from at the risk exposure limit to approximately five ( 5 ) thousand dollars below the risk exposure limit. Despite this pattern of maintaining my financial obligations and conducting myself in accordance with responsible lending, American Express stated that the reason my accounts had been canceled was because of financial review and the fact that Id been late for ALL months in the past five ( 5 ) consecutive months. When I asked the Representative how the review was conducted and who within the Responsible Lending area had conducted the review, the representative explained to me that the process was conducted by a machine and that no individual had actually reviewed the file. 

Upon being transferred to a Responsible Lending team in XXXX, I was told that unless I agreed to ACH transactions for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, the same system that deemed me to be a risk to American Express for lending was subject to send my accounts for external collection. I inquired about the amount the bank would be trying to collect on the representative couldnt tell me. When I asked why the bank would seek to collect BEFORE considering the outstanding balance to be a loss and charging-off the balance, the representative could not answer. After speaking with a supervisor, the representative returned stating that the process the bank uses to collect funds is at their discretion. 

My payments were in excess of my obligations per my statements from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, my charging history was below what it was for the same period a year prior. And, my average balance for each month from the period of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX was below 2000 dollars per month with the exception of XX/XX/XXXX. In fact, my overall spending on the card over the aforementioned period was similar to the spending habits when I first obtained the card nearly four years ago. Yet, American express continued to bill me in excess of 2000 dollars for those particular months. 

American Express Therefore, it would appear that America Express ' back-end analytics target members in a way that maximizes their profit while minimizing their risk exposure by purposely targeting accounts for closure. American Express ' analytics system seems to rely on the assumption that a member with a non-zero pay-over-time balance would be incapable of paying the balance in full at time of cancellation. The scheme appears to be such that if a pay over time balance exists on the account, under any indication of an inability to pay, the analytics system will close the accounts, such that no future charges may be made, but future profits can be made because there exists a nonzero pay-over-time balance on the account. Furthermore, the analytics system also seems to reduce risk exposure limits below a certain amount that makes the card unusalbe immediately after payments have been applied to the account to meet alleged outstanding payment obligations. 

Overall, I lost my grandmother, an American Express card member. At the same time I nearly lost her husband, my grandfather, also an American Express card member for over three decades. The only reason I even have an American Express card is because I saw them with theirs and the presumed success it embodied, and what I thought was a quality banking institution with good customer service. Unfortunately, despite attempting to maintain a good relationship with American Express, I have been penalized for bank transfer errors, payment accounting errors, and insensitive representatives seeking to schedule a payment during a time of grieving and loss. In essence, I got trapped in between accounting irregularities, computer bugs, and poor customer service that is outsourced to XXXX. 

The sad thing is that when I told my grandfather about the experience I had, my grandfathers response was that he, again a card member for decades, had been subject to similar experiences such that while he still has the card, he no longer uses it.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,0

"The issue is with Capital One Bank ( USA ), N.A. and their recently acquired Cabelas 's CLUB Visa card. Unfortunately, I was unable to make my minimum payment. The account was 60 days past due. I made a more than minimum amount payment on my next due date, bringing the account current and reducing the balance to a level below the credit limit. Unbeknownst to me, my account had been cancelled and closed ( pending payoff the remaining balance ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I received this written correspondence after making the payment.

In reviewing my documentation, my account statement dated XX/XX/XXXX made no mention nor offered any warning of possible account closure. I received no other correspondence.

Not only does this mean that the account is no longer available to me to use, but my overall available credit will now be reduced as well, which will negatively impact my credit score. This will likely lead to adverse consequences with other credit accounts as well. In addition, Capital One states that my Cabela 's CLUB points ( loyalty rewards totally {$31.00} ) are forfeited.

I reached out to Capital One to discuss this matter. I spoke with front-line account & credit desk representatives who, while courteous & professional, provided no new information nor offered any progressive action or offered any recourse available to me ; they did mention that I can request my loyalty/shopping rewards via a gift card once the account balance is paid off. In other words, they are holding already earned rewards for ransom of the account balance. Were the account open, these rewards could be utilized at any time. This is not only poor customer service, but an unfair practice given that CLUB points can be earned & redeemed without a Visa card.

I also spoke with a credit supervisor who was polite but rather flippant. When I asked why no warning was provided, she simply stated that such information would not provided with an account statement. She also stated that such reviews happen at the end of the month, regardless of billing cycles. First of all, XX/XX/XXXX was not the end of the business month. Secondly, if the company can make decisions in-between statement dates without notice, the cardholder is at a distinct disadvantage. This overall lack of information means that the company and the cardholder are not playing by the same set of rules.

Finally, the supervisor informed me that the account had been sent to a collection agency, XXXX. I received no correspondence from this company and have not dealt with them. It seems that Capital One sought to abdicate their responsibility for appropriate customer service and to ensure that cardholders are not given the opportunity to effectively deal with challenges relating to their accounts.

I have had financial difficulties before and never once had these type of actions taken on this account when it was owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The card business transfer has not been a positive shift for this consumer.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,0
"I attempted to use my Citi double cash back CC to pay the final invoice for a new roof for my house which totalled over {$6000.00} but was still well beneath the available balance on our card. Last month I paid the same exact company a deposit for the work which has already posted to my CC statement. The transaction this time for the remaining balance would not go through. I immediately logged online to see what the problem was and received a vague message saying that they suspected fraudulent charges and to call the phone number provided. I am an authorized user on the account but the representative said they could only speak with the primary account holder, my husband who is currently in XXXX. I explained that he was XXXX but had authorized me to use the account and that I can confirm the charge, which was on my card. The representative literally just repeated over and over that she could only talk to the primary. I tried relentlessly to explain that he can not just pick up a phone because he is in XXXX. I was given no other option, no email or online verification process or anything. She transfered me to her supervisor who was beyond reprehensible. I have never experienced such poor customer service. I was extremely distressed and in an incredibly vulnerable situation with my husband XXXX and they offered me no options, sympathy, or advice. I asked repeatedly for an explanation of Citi CC policy for authorized users, what rights do authorized users have in general and she would not tell me anything she just kept saying she couldn't talk to me at all because I was not a primary account holder and she refused to transfer me to anyone else. She finally said I could send in my power of attorney to be able to access the account but the only option is mailing it to a PO Box address and then waiting 5-7 days after they receive it for processing before they will even tell me what is going on with the account in the first place, let alone unlock it. After several distressing messages to my husband he tracked down a phone to call the number Citi CC gave us for him to be able to unlock the account, keep in mind he is calling long distance from XXXX. When he called they STILL refused to unlock the account and verify his identity because they couldn't call his cell phone number that is listed on the account!!!!!! He gave his SSN and answered every other question and because he can't answer his cell phone they wont confirm it's him and refuse to unlock our account or even say what the XXXX is going on in the first place. How is this fraud protection benefiting us??????? They said they would have to mail a letter to our house with a verification code that my husband will then have to call back from XXXX to Citi and tell them the code to unlock the account. So again our only option is to wait 5-7 days for something to travel in the mail. The entire reason we got this CC was to pay for our roof with 0 % interest while we wait for reimbursement from our home insurance company. Now I face having a late payment and screwing over my roofing company because my credit is tied up on a card I can't use. We had several different options for 0 % interest but now we suffer the consequences of a hit to our credit if we walk away from Citi to open a different account or the potential of paying interest on the balance using one of our other cards while we wait for reimbursement. I simply can not believe that this company has no other way to resolve an issue like this. We weren't even the ones who reported potential fraud. I simply tried to use my authorized card to pay a vendor that we paid before with no dispute. My husband called from XXXX gave all his identifying information. I stated the exact charge that I tried to make that they froze the account over. How can they justifiably keep us locked out of the account under the guise of fraud protection when the only thing we couldn't do was answer my husband 's cell phone number or read a text message because the service is disconnected because he is in XXXX!!

"Chase Bank charged interest on my XXXX XXXX, XXXX statement.

I was charged interest of {$30.00} on XXXX XXXX for the statement period in which I paid over and above my balance. 

I contacted Chase on this matter and was told that they practice "" Two Cycle Billing '' by XXXX different agents ( XXXX & XXXX ). I explained to them that there was already an interest charge on the prior statement for the ~ {$100.00} shortage in payment on my end but that I had paid in full for this statement period. XXXX agents proceeded to describe their double cycle billing and informed me that this was Chase ' policy to charge interest for two billing cycles when there is a month in which the entire balance is unpaid. They described this as a "" loss of grace period ''. 
Per my reading of the CARD Act of XXXX, this is prohibited ( FTC link to CARD Act below ). I spoke with a manager ( XXXX ) at Chase and informed him of the provisions in the CARD Act prohibiting Double Cycle Billing, he silently agreed and promptly removed the interest charge from my account.

I can not even see the statements at this point thus I do n't even know what charges Discover is holding my liable for as of now that equals my total current balance.

We own a time share in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and were touring a different time share property. We declined to purchase the other time share but were referred to another area of the company where they offered to purchase our time share in exchange for joining their membership club. We were told they would purchase our time share property for {$39000.00} if we paid {$13000.00} for the membership via applying for an XXXX XXXX XXXX signature card through Bank of America. 

We agreed to this transaction solely on their promise to purchase our time share property.

However, after several weeks where we received no further communication with the company and after several telephone calls and email attempts to contact them, the purchase of our time share never happened. 

We believe that Bank of America participated in this fraudulent activity by providing the credit for payment of the {$13000.00} membership fee even though the time share company never had the intent of purchasing or time share property to start with.

"I recently had several experiences with my XXXX XXXX Visa card, which explicitly says and is marketed as having no foreign transaction fees, that indicate something like a foreign transaction fee is being charged. What is actually happening is that Chase Bank and Visa ( and XXXX XXXX XXXX are complicit in allowing XXXX to mark up exchange rates so that the rate applied to a purchase in a foreign currency, when exchanged into dollars, is about 2.5 % higher than the rate that would be used if actual market-based exchange rates, published daily from, say, the XXXX XXXX XXXX, were applied. In my case, Chase Bank says they just go by what Visa uses and thereby allow Visa to mark up exchange rates by about 2.5 %, in my experience. In doing this, Chase and XXXX perpetrate the misleading, nay bait and switch, marketing they use to encourage people to get their "" no foreign transaction fee '' credit cards ; indeed, the 2.5 % markup, though not billed as a foreign transaction fee, merely substitutes for such a fee because this extra 2.5 % should not be charged at all. Card holders are not unreasonable to assume, and Chase and Visa do not transparently disabuse us that, we will be receiving a market-based exchange rate ( with no additional markup ). In trying to talk with Chase ( who talks to Visa while XXXX sits idly by ), there is no way to get this situation corrected.

Even when there was no due for XX/XX/XXXXper the XXXX   account online and automated call, I knew I had 2 expiring 0 % interest promos with a total balance of {$1600.00} ending on XX/XX/XXXXwhich also had substantial accrued interest charges. I am aware that interest accrued charges need to be paid if the balance on the promo plans are not paid in full by the expiration date. I absolutely did not want to pay the accrued charges which amounted to {$1100.00} for promo plan XXXX and {$180.00} for promo plan XXXX. So, on XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$1700.00} online to pay off both promo plans expiring onXX/XX/XXXX

On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that my balance was not reduced knowing I paid off promo plans that expired inXX/XX/XXXX. I discovered that I was charged the accrued interest rates for the plans XXXX and XXXX which expired onXX/XX/XXXX7. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX  and spoke with XXXX. I initiated a dispute regarding the charges and was told that I will receive a letter for confirmation.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX to follow up my dispute and they stated it is still ongoing. Around XX/XX/XXXX I called again to follow-up and they stated that the dispute has been closed and they are still charging me the accrued interest rates. The representative did not give me a reason for their decision and told me it would be stated in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX.

I received the 2nd and last mail from XXXX in the week of XX/XX/XXXX. The mail datedXX/XX/XXXX explained why they are denying the dispute. Their explanation in the letter states I accrued the interest charges because I did not pay the promo balance in full by the expiration date. I can not accept their decision since I paid the balance of the 2 promo plans expiring on XX/XX/XXXX in full on XX/XX/XXXX.

I called XXXX again to speak with a manager regarding my dispute. He explained that I did not pay the balance of the 2 promos expiring on XX/XX/XXXX which was written on the statements. He also stated the amount was not enough to pay for the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX. I told him no where in the statement it is written that I had to pay the minimum due plus the balance in full for the promos expiring. I also checked online after I made the XX/XX/XXXX payments for the promo expiring XX/XX/XXXX to ensure no payments are due for XX/XX/XXXXand it reflected a {$0.00} due.

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, a supervisor and told him to reopen the case since the resolution was not acceptable to me. I had 2 promos expiring on XX/XX/XXXX and told him I wanted the higher balance paid off first if my XX/XX/XXXX payment was allocated first to the minimum due onXX/XX/XXXX and the balance to pay the promo plans expiring onXX/XX/XXXX. It also doesnt make sense that my payment was not allocated to XX/XX/XXXXpromo plans first vs XX/XX/XXXX7 which comes after XX/XX/XXXX. I should have just been slapped with a late fee if my payments onXX/XX/XXXX went to pay for the promo expiring XX/XX/XXXXand there was nothing left to pay for the XX/XX/XXXX min due.

I started my complaint within the 120 day of discovering the discrepancy ( in the XX/XX/XXXX statement receivedXX/XX/XXXX ) dispute and told them my intention is for them to pay first in full the bigger balance which carried the higher accrued interest of $ {$1100.00}. I asked for a valid reason how they allocate if there were 2 plans expiring the same time and they told me its just their process and gave me no documentation. To me this is unfair business practice that they would take advantage for the customer to be dinged with the higher interest accrual even when I tell them within the 120 day dispute window that they need to correct the allocation of payment.

I feel that XXXX  conducts unfair business practices and takes advantage of the customer by not sending documentation of their process and not acknowledging issues/glitches in their system. Specially when their system states {$0.00} due so a customer would not pay that time and then having a big payment for a plan expiring allocated to the minimum due resulting in the customer paying the hefty incurred interest of the promo plan.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,0

"I have already cancelled one XXXX credit card over recent changes to terms with Firearms sellers. However the recent revelation that my major financial institution, Bank of America, is among those institutions looking at ways to track/limit my purchase of a legal product intended for lawful uses. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) has the potential to make it nearly impossible to go about daily life without agreeing to give up my fundamental constitutional rights. 

The ability to use a credit card with freedom from viewpoint discrimination is critical to life in modern society. The CFPB was created because it was understood that financial decisions by private corporations can destroy the lives of millions of individual customers if not handled fairly and honestly. Asking customers to expose themselves to having their transactions arbitrarily denied, or cards cancelled, based on what we choose to purchase is an overstepping of boundaries. Such decisions should only be made on financial grounds like card balance limits, not what is being purchased. 

Imagine a world in which your purchases are denied solely becuase your life choices do not match the whims of the corporation on any particular day. No XXXX transactions because our company makes more profit from large taxi companies. No political donations to members of the political parties that our executives don't support. Sorry, we can't process your monthly XXXX bill payment because our corporate cell provider is XXXX. Expressing your corporate opinion via charity or special incentives is one thing and is understandable. Forcing your corporate opinion in the private lives of your customers is another thing and is totally unacceptable. 

Just because these corporate policies take care to not stray into legally protected areas of discrimination like race and religion doesn't make viewpoint discrimination right even if it may not have violated any laws, at least not yet. No matter which side any individual takes on any issue, I doubt most customers want their credit card companies second guessing their individual purchasing decisions on a daily basis. The potential for abuse is just too large, and such policies may need to be regulated if corporations continue down this path.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,1

In the past two weeks, I have spoken with 4 different relationship managers in the Loan Modification Department ( MAP dept ) at U.S. Bank. I still have not had any resolution. My credit report continues to incorrectly show that I'm 120+ days past due, which is significantly hurting my credit score and likely why I have a high interest rate on my vehicle loan and have not yet been able to refinance it. I also found out that in addition to U.S. Bank not updating my loan and payments with the credit bureau, nothing has been sent to the Recorder 's office where I live. It seems that absolutely nothing was done after the paperwork was signed and returned.

"I have been a loyal card member of XXXX XXXX for 2 years and couldnt be happier with my decision to join the XXXX XXXX Family. Youve always offered some of the most competitive rates and rewards programs. 
Unfortunately, in XX/XX/XXXX I took advantage of our relationship and failed to submit my monthly payments on time. It was an exceptionally busy time in my life as I was balancing being sick and out of work at that time and fell behind on other bills too. I was the only person working and am the only on that had a job at the time. I contacted your representative in XX/XX/XXXX to find out what I can do to make my relationship better with XXXX XXXX and she in turn stated to me that if I paid the whole balance while being on the phone with her she can promise me that my account would be erased of all the negative late payments from the past and brought current and have my privileges for using the card issued again. The amount that she asked for was {$420.00} I believe. I in turn agreed to that taking place since I knew in the near future that I was going to be buying a home and wanted to make things better with XXXX XXXX. I have since fulfilled my agreement and have been making on time payments also making more than the regular payment due at times. I was under the impression that this was a verbal contract since I fulfilled my part and XXXX XXXX has only fulfilled half of their agreement with me. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, when I pulled my credit I noticed that the late payments were still on there so I call on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX  which he stated that he reviewed my account and saw that the dates that I was referring to were correct and that he was going to submit it to the department that corrects the three credit bureaus and that it would take 60-90 days for it to affect my credit. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX letting my know that they researched it and due to the FCRA that they could not make any changes. I called and spoke with XXXX ( which was a manager ) and she looked into my account and said that since I was promised this to be removed and she would place another report using a different way from the last one that XXXX  proceeded to write it in. She also said that it would take 60-90 days for it to be corrected and it should be no problem since she verified everything with me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received yet another letter stating the same from the previous letters that I have received. I once again called and asked to speak to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX, the department that the letter came from and was informed that there was no such department so I asked to speak to a manger again and I was connected to XXXX. I explained my situation again to him and he had me on hold for several minutes and came back on and told me again about the FCRA and it could not be done but understood that the lady I first spoke to promised me something that could not have been done. I then stated that it was wrong for her to promise me something since I believed it was a verbal contract and I fulfilled my side of the agreement. If I would have known this I would have just had it been a charge off since that hit on my credit and my FICO would have had less of an impact verses the late payments that I have on it now. I am just asking for my promise to be made valid and my late payments be removed. The dates for the late payments are XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. I paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX when I was promised all of the late payments would be removed from my credit. I am hoping that you can fulfill your side and make my credit positive again with all three credit bureaus.

I ask Experian for my credit report and received a report # XXXX for XX/XX/18 ( this is my second one i requested ) and i pretty sure i went to their website and dispute that account online and called dispute center to told them they need to start an investigate that account because it's not belong to me and they said it ' going to take around 30 days, ok i wait and keep checking my credit report online and today XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX i called dispute center of Experian to ask what happen to the investigation and they said it's going to start today and i need to wait 30 days more. WHAT??? that's mean they did not not do anything to help me resolve my problem at all after i got my second report on XX/XX/2018.

My credit limit was lowered by 80 % and I can not do anything until this case is resolved. I was on the brink of buying a house for my family but due to this, I am forced to withhold the joy for my family. I am holding you responsible for this matter when it could have been dealt with at the beginning.

I willing to work with them to fix it but just let me wait for nothing.

I don't know how is this credit systems work but if Experian does not take that seriously please let me out of their systems because the way they work is hurting me so badly i don't see any benefit at this point.

Who going to help me out with this mess. After wait for 30 days for investigation and another 30 days is coming who going to guaranty with me this is a last 30 days.

The Experian letter says nothing at all about where to send the required information, although it does display a small post office box address at the top left of the form letter.

"Around XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX a CS Rep from NCS contacted me, I believe by the name of XXXX, regarding collecting a debt on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, is the company that I had previously reported to FTC for Identity Theft. I let the rep know that I did not owe a debt to this company because they were claiming to be a Property Management Co. and according to GA law, once a judge has issued a writ of possession in court there are no more recoverable damages that XXXX XXXX could obtain unless they sue me in small claims court or the Magistrate Court, if the claim is less than {$15000.00}. After case # XXXX, was dismissed and closed. XXXX XXXX opened up another case, once they discovered I had moved out of the property and I was never served for, Case # XXXX because I moved to another state. Therefore, I never went to court regarding this case. Also, XXXX XXXX took the liberty of reopening case # XXXX a year later in XX/XX/XXXX to withdraw the paid judgment that they had added to Public Records on my XXXX credit report, which was the reason why I reported them for identity theft. Thanks to CFPB, that judgment was recently removed from my XXXX Credit report. Now they are going after my XXXX Credit report and a year later of stating that I owe {$14.00}, XXXX. I left that property in XX/XX/XXXX owing nothing due to me filing Bankruptcy lawsuits against this company. I also informed the NCS rep, of never receiving my deposit from XXXX XXXX. I did not receive a valid reason for the company to keep my deposit because the company never performed a walk through. The move-in inspection requirement applies to landlords who owns more than XXXX rental units, including units owned by their spouse and/or children, or who employ a management agent regardless of the number of units owned.

Well, the NCS rep simply did not care about my concerns and she simply hung up on me. Before, she hung up on me, I even requested that she mail me documentation to verify the validity of this debt and I never received it. I even stated to her that all of my mail is transferred to me, for security reasons, yet I never received anything from NCS.I pulled my credit report with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and noticed NCS had put that horrendous collection on my credit report. Not only did XXXX XXXX list that unlawful and illegal debt., they also committed fraud again by having their business address show on my credit report as a verified address. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, TN ) This could only apply if I applied for credit with their address. They even enlisted the services of XXXX Credit Bureau to ensure that my renter history is also tainted, to prevent me from obtaining a liveable rental residence for my family.

"I work as an admin assistant for a small church, and they decided the switch from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX at first tried really hard to keep us ; having several sales people offer discounts and such but when they realized we were not going to change our mind, their tone changed rather quickly and we were told that we were still under contract ; owing them several thousand dollars but get this, it would still take a few months to cancel the service! So we would have to pay our monthly bill for services that they were not providing AND pay this ridiculous amount for early termination and whatever other fees! This really did not make any sense, and calls were made to XXXX to get clarity on the matter. Their customer service and sales people however, give you different information, so you ca n't really trust that what person A is saying is really true because person B will tell you the opposite. Even though I was not the main contact for this process, as the admin, I receive all the mail and answer the phone so therefore I was able to see how fast this issue became an unnecessary problem. After receiving a few notices from XXXX in the mail, soon started the phone calls from collections. And how they called, over, and over, and over again. Even after I explained that they were calling a CHURCH, and that it was n't me personally that could solve the issue, they kept calling. I blocked at least XXXX different numbers : XXXX and XXXX.

And then they write : "" we have completed our due diligence and fully documented our efforts to cooperate with you '' ... .Really? You made copies of the XXXX letters you sent us? Wow, good for you. They did not even address our letter with our Church 's name - just our address saying "" accounts payable ''. I have worked in debt collections before, and it absolutely kills me that companies like Sage Capital Recovery treat people who owe money like second class citizens. I understand that we all have a job to do, but there is such a thing as ethical and fair business practices. Recording how many letters you spit out on a daily basis does not mean you have done your "" due diligence ''.

13. My first payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX and when they contacted me to remind me about this payment, I explained to them that it would be a couples days late. I began receiving 7-10 phone calls, random text messages, and repeated calls to my employer over the next week from our first conversation. I finally spoke to the company rep again and she proceeded to call me "" ghetto trash '' while cursing and degrading me over the phone.

As time went along receiving multiple calls, text messages from the employees personal cell phones pretending to be a friend or acquaintance of mine, I ignored the harassment. First Heritage filed a motion against me in civil court. We agreed upon a payment arrangement during this court date and I agreed to make monthly payments to the local court clerks office. The attorney there representing First Heritage was nice, but simply told me that the amount was going to be higher because he wanted his money too. I ended up filing for bankruptcy in XXXX of XXXX, but the trustee denied my repayment plan agreement based upon a job change with higher income. This resulted in my attorney dismissing that request and refiling with a new repayment plan in XXXX of XXXX. First Heritage Credit was included and notified of all of these motions per federal bankruptcy rules. First Heritage received payments on a total balance of {$XXXX} worth of debt owed to them in accordance to the repayment plan that was approved and managed by the bankruptcy trustee from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a dismissal from my bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX based on the fact that I feel like I can manage the small amount of debt I have, outside of student loans, on my own. The case was officially dismissed, per my request, on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from a First Heritage rep stating that I had made no payments and that my balance was in excess of {$XXXX}. I explained to him the situation, but he was extremely rude. He stated that I didn't request the bankruptcy dismissal and that the payment I was in agreement and able to afford wasn't enough for them. I pulled all of my paperwork up and called the rep back. I advised him that there was a total of {$XXXX} paid toward the debt and that the balance he gave me was incorrect.He was adamant that I was wrong and threatened legal action.

The annual percentage rate for the original loan was XXXX  %. I'm not sure how much in attorney fees have been added to my account, but the rep advised me today that interest was being charged daily since the loan origination date and that XXXXy didn't matter because it wouldn't protect me from daily interest charges even though payments were being made to them. I feel like this company has unethical business practices. I am in no way disputing the fact that I owe for this loan, but I am firmly in disagreement with the erroneous fees and collection practices in place.I am willing to make monthly payments that fit my budget in order to still be able to maintain my household and feed my child.

I explained to the individual again that I believe this is identity fraud as I have never visited this doctor, I live in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and I have health Insurance and if I did I would have paid him. She stated that I would need to contact the creditor directly to resolve it. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Doctor 's office directly speaking with the billing department. She confirmed that the individual in question for the outstanding debt was not me. She confirmed my age, address, and social security number. 
She stated that the collection agency was in error and she would contact them directly. 
Which she did and called me back stating that the Capital Accounts LLC would be contacting me and retracting the negative collection on my report.

To be treated so terribly was shocking. The collection agency was able within days to discredit my Score and Credit Report with all 3 credit bureaus with no evidence, physical proof or documentation. I have had to prove my innocence, but they don't have to prove my guilty? And now I could wait up to 90 days for this to be resolved. Will this actually be removed completely?

I have called XXXX and they can not show anything on their end to support this company contacting me or stating that I owe a debt.

I do not deal with 3rd party collection agencies, I do not pay a debt to someone that I never heard of nor agreed to pay, by them sending me a letter stating that this is an attempt to collect a debt, that translates into them wanting to do me financial harm.

If they purchased this debt since they say they are the new owners and that XXXX or XXXX XXXX has closed or charged off the debt that means that legally no debt from the original creditor exists at this time, then they would have bought the original signed contract showing a legal debt and legal obligation to pay.

"I have attached a copy of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau order of XX/XX/2015 pertaining to the collection process on medical debts. This federal agency has levied millions in penalties against several medical collection agencies for abusive collection practices since the XX/XX/2015 mandate that consumers must be granted 180 days-notice that any or all medical debts can not be posted against a consumers credit report. What this entails is that I as an American consumer needs time to either settle a medical collection before said collection gets posted on my credit report, or that my medical insurance carrier had enough time to resolve the collection either in full or by any sustained factoring agreement in place with the medical servicer, be it a physician, clinic, ambulance service or hospital. That has not been the case in the attached medical collection ( s ) posted on XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX XXXX respectfully. Since the XX/XX/2015 agreement between the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and all three credit reporting agencies, medical collection agencies have violated this agreement in its entirety. Having established that there is a specified procedure in place on medical collection postings on a consumers credit, it is a fact that most if not all medical collectors are in violation of their subscriber agreement with the major credit reporting agencies. Since my rights have already been violated by the collection agency stated in this complaint, the collection should be VOID completely. I am not disputing any factual conclusion if I was even given medical attention, just stating that my personal credit history has been damaged by an unlawful collection practice. I should be entitled to damages for the overall cost involved with what would otherwise be a perfect credit history. Accordingly, I respectfully request for the disputed medical collection ( s ) to be deleted permanently, and if this particular collection agencies needs a remedy for collection, it has abused the credit reporting system by violating my rights. In my opinion the only recourse at this time would be moving forward through other collection processes outside of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The disputed collection must be deleted permanently, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must sanction and fine the agency for its abusive actions. The credit reporting agencies should also terminate the subscriber agreement if place. My dispute is based on material facts and current policies on medical collections. The attached disputed collection ( s ) should be deleted permanently without any right to reinsert from this point forward.",Debt collection,1,0

In XX/XX/XXXX, an amount of {$410.00} was erroneously auto-debited from my account. This was more than both my IDR or my full repayment price.

I was also told I submitted my IDR paperwork late to put my IDR in place for this cycle, but this was untrue as I submitted the paperwork by XX/XX/XXXX which gave ample time for the 30 day processing period cited to me when I signed up for the IBR plan.

Also the interest rate on the loan is 5.96 %. I am using my HELOC loan to pay off Nelnet Student loan because the HELOC interest rate is 3.25 % which is less than Nelnet Student Loan. This delay tactics by Nelnet makes me to pay double interest for 4 to 5 days.

"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX VW of XXXX XXXX, CA. When I was discussing financing options with the Finance Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX, he described a pre-paid VW maintenance plan that was available that would cover my scheduled maintenance on my vehicle. He indicated that if I purchased it now at a price of {$1000.00}, I will be covered for my XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX miles scheduled maintenance with no additional out of pocket cost at time of service. He provided me estimates of each scheduled service and after crunching the numbers, the deal made sense and I agreed to the maintenance plan of {$1000.00} that was included in the financing of my vehicle. 
In XXXX XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX or XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I believe ), I contacted VW Financial Services to ensure I fully understood my pre-paid maintenance plan and what it covered. I asked the representative if my plan covered XXXX mile service and she confirmed that it indeed did cover those maintenance services. This put me at ease knowing that XXXX at XXXX and the VW Representative confirmed the same thing. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I brought my vehicle in for my XXXX service to XXXX VW of XXXX, CA. When I notified the service center what I needed done on my vehicle, I was told that I would have to pay out of pocket for my XXXX service of approximately {$300.00}. They indicated that whoever processed my prepaid maintenance plan at time of vehicle purchase only signed me up for the XXXX and XXXX mile service, and not the XXXX and XXXX mile service. They stated that there are XXXX plans that can be purchased, which is the VW Care package that covers the XXXX and XXXX mile service and the VW Care Plus package that covered the XXXX and XXXX mile service. XXXX at XXXX apparently only signed me up for the VW Care Plus package even though he had confirmed I would be covered from XXXX miles at a financed cost of {$1000.00}. I spoke to the Service Manager at XXXX and he re-confirmed what I was signed up for and advised that he could not do anything further as that it what was shown in their system. I notified him that I should be covered for XXXX as I did not pay for the XXXX mile service performed at XXXX several months ago. They said that after looking at their records, they saw that the Service Technician apparently processed it incorrectly and when they submitted the reimbursement to VW, they were denied it and they had to 'eat ' the cost for my XXXX mile service.

He offered his advise to refinance at a lower interest rate ( currently at 11.25 % ) or suggested that the borrower and myself pay-off the loan. 

It is my understanding that an interest reduction plan should be for that period of time and after that plan is complete, the consumer should n't get penalized for the plan by adding the lost interest back to the loan.

"Navient, the nation 's largest servicer of student loans, has for years misled borrowers and made serious mistakes at nearly every step of the collections process, illegally driving up loan repayment costs for XXXX of borrowers, according to lawsuits filed on Wednesday by a federal regulator and two state attorneys general. 
From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, CFPB estimates that Navient 's practices cost borrowers up to XXXX in extra interest by repeatedly enrolling borrowers in forbearance. CFPB also found that many federal student loan borrowers were unaware that the government could pay part of the interest charges on their loans when personal circumstances prevent borrowers from keeping up. 

The lawsuit names Navient and two of its subsidiaries : Navient Solutions, the corporate division responsible for loan servicing operations, and another subsidiary, Pioneer Credit Recovery that collects on defaulted student loans with the parent corporation. All three entities are charged with systematically making it harder for borrowers by incorrectly processing payments or failing to effectively act when borrowers complained. Instead of assisting borrowers with available options for repayment, CFPB charges that borrowers were steered into forbearance, a temporary and high cost solution that suspends payments but allows interest rates to continue accruing.",Loans,0,0

 XX/XX/XXXX  - Called   XXXX   XXXX   and was told that my loan had been transferred.   XXXX   XXXX   informed me that since my account had moved, I could not make a payment to   XXXX   XXXX   - but had to make a payment to the new company. I was told to wait until I got a letter.

 XX/XX/XXXX  - Received a letter from   XXXX   XXXX   ( dated  XX/XX/XXXX  ) that my students loan were being transferred to Fed Loan. Also there is a statement in the letter "" If ED does n't transfer your account as planned, we 'll let you know. '' This line indicated to me - that the loan still might not get transferred. And this coupled with the fact that I received two letters previously with conflicting messages about my loan 's status with the transfer - I did n't know if this would even go through.
 XX/XX/XXXX at  XXXX  ( EDT ) - I called Fed Loan and was told that my accounts still had not transferred. I would have to wait 10-15 business days to do anything with my loans - i.e. I could not yet make a payment.

 XX/XX/XXXX  - Received an email from Fed Loan that my student loan payment was late and that my payment date was  XX/XX/XXXX .
 XX/XX/XXXX   XXXX  ( EDT ) I called and spoke with  XXXX  ( cust rep # :  XXXX  ) - Was told that my payment was n't late and that it would n't show up as late until 3 months of not paying. I disagreed with her on both of her statements. When I mentioned that I had received a late notice and therefore her company 's system clearly was marking my account as late - she kept repeating the payment was n't late. I asked  XXXX  why her company did not send me an email on the   XXXX   letting me know my payment date was that day. Her response was that my account was still being processed on the   XXXX   - that their system did not have my account in their system yet. I asked why they waited 11 days to send me ANY communication, especially when the account was late. She had no answer. I also asked why I had not received a welcome letter that outlined the specifics for my account transfer and she did not answer my question but merely stated that I should have known my due date would have been the same. I then asked her why anyone would think that when transferring to a different loan payment program AND transferring from a different company that all the terms of your student loan would stay the same. She said that I should have known.
<P/><P/>
Concern : I do not want my  XX/XX/XXXX  payment to show as late. ( I have paid it. ) I want the late payment reference removed. Why is this so important? Part of being on the PSLF program is that I make 10 years ( 120 payments ) ALL ON TIME. I can be thrown off the program for one late payment.
<P/><P/>
Based on the lack of written communication, customer service representatives giving me false information ( when  XXXX  stated my payment was not late ), and the fact that I was given an email 11 days AFTER the payment due date - BUT yet, never had gotten an email on the   XXXX   or even  XXXX  that said "" Your account has been brought over - pay now '' - I suspect that companies might be setting things up so that people will have late payments - so they can be removed from the PSLF program.

The total I 'm paying on to the rehab company is the total I thought I owed on ALL student loan debt, and I have n't been receiving any mail, phone calls, or any sort of contact from Loan to Learn, so I started trying to call them.

"I recieved in the mail a letter explaining that I qualified for a XXXX loan which could be paid back in installments instea of the next paycheck payoff.

It simply gave me the imprestion the loan would not have to be paid back the next pay period, rather I would be able to make payments. I was hesitant in getting involved with this with concerns that it would be a repeat event from a payday loan I took out for 5 days and ended up paying hundreds of dollars back. I did not want at all to get mixed up in that again. I was given a phone number to call XXXX I called the number and started the loan proccess. I spoke with someone who I can only assume was a representative of the company. she said lots of things about loan and about truth and lending but did n't disclose the interest It wasnt till after I accepted the loan offer was I made aware that the {$400.00} loan would be financed at over 600. % interest. and that if I were going to be making all the payments I would be paying {$200.00}. on each consecutive payday ( the XXXX unless its on a weekend ) until the loan was paid back totaling {$1900.00} or a onetime payment of {$600.00}. at this point I was taken back by this info and quickly put to paper the the XXXX found out that they are not charging the amount that the interest came to be they rounded down or something.

I am not asking that they change me no interest, I was asking if they would lower the interest to a more reasonable rate, since I am in good standing and have proven my ability to repay. I was misled by the initial paperwork I received and that this company clearly takes advantage of the public. I am paying back over 50 % in interest and processing fees.

"this is additional information concerning my complaint number XXXX. My Names is XXXX XXXX. 
I did some research on my own and the loan I took out in XXXX was a Bank of America Clean Sweep Loan, however this loan was done over the phone with a customer representative. The Loan was a one time deposit of {$37000.00} dollars and the fixed rate of 15.9 % which came to payments of {$660.00} for 72 months ( 6 years ). The representative was clear on the fixed rate. I understand those loans may have been advertised by Bank of America as variable rates through other advertising for these type loans. 
The deception here is the customer service rep closing the deal. I would never sign on for a variable rate loan, having already bought a house with fixed rated, my automobiles are fixed, he sold me on the fixed rate, the payment amount and the length of the loan. 
As I state before Bank of America has since discontinued these loans in XXXX according to their customer representatives, to include calling them line of credits and credit cards. 
My most recent conversation with their representatives is that XXXX, as in my previous complaint I was told they would investigate further, but the customer representatives I spoke with on XXXX XXXX, XXXX had no notes or action taken on my account. so we spent XXXX hours on between being on hold and one customer representative and a supervisor trying to give me an explanation as to what may have happened. 
After an attempt to say I have more payments because I missed payments from the representative who knew nothing about these loans of programs, the supervisor acknowledged that I had never missed any payments. Her final answer was that I had a variable rate when I took out the loan, and that in XXXX the loan was changed to a fixed rate of 15.9 % and the 60 month term started then. The 60 month term that is reflected on the document I submitted with claim XXXX, that they provided to me. 
None of what I have been told had added up. First the loan has always been 15.9 %. To claim it went from a variable to fixed rated, and term starting two years after I have had the loan, is questionable. The supervisor telling me the 60 month term went into effect in XXXX tells me they have not kept an accurate history of my account, like I said before I have paid over 90 months ( almost 8 years on this account ). 
In summary the Bank of America Clean Sweep Loan is what this started out as. This customer service rep presented this loan as fixed rate fixed payments. Bank of America has done modifications to this loan, in XXXX and XXXX. The customer reps and supervisors have made it clear they have not been able to articulate an accurate history of my account, that is either because the account history is incomplete, has too many modifications to articulate accurately or they are towing the party line and facilitating unethical practices for Bank of America.",Loans,1,0

At the time I applied I was new to the area, not working and my husband had just joined the XXXX. The financial Aid office handled all the paperwork related to loans, financial aid, etc. When I first started paying the loans I was getting hit with late fees because I was under the assumption I had XXXX loans, so I consolidated them and I was still getting hit with late fees and that's when I called into XXXX XXXX ( at the time ) and was told I had XXXX loans ( XXXX ) federal loans ( which they considered XXXX loan ) totaling XXXX and ( XXXX ) private loan XXXX. I set the accounts up on easy pay and forgot all about it until my husband and I got into an argument over money and the loans were brought up. Its been 11 years of paying them. I make an account online with Navient who is now my lender and servicer. I was astonished to see that only XXXX dollars has come off a XXXX loan paying $ XXXX. That's when I found out about variable interest rates ( which I still don't understand because they charge me higher than the prime rate ) and my loan balance started at XXXX because of interest accrued. I was told that no interest would accrue while I was in school, then I was explained it only applied to federal loans. I know if this type of loan was explained to me I would have never agreed. Now I want proof I agreed to these terms and I was told they had a signed promissory note. I requested a copy and I received a paper with not a signature but a typed name. One red flag to me was it was in all lower case letters. I never type my name on any document without capitalizing the first letter in my first and last name, and my middle initial. It was not signed by any school official. I reach out to the school for the paperwork and they closed in XXXX and the only documents available are my transcripts through the state. I reach out to financial aid they have no paperwork on me because financial aid was never applied for. The private loan was obtained before the federal loans. Back on the phone with Navient I explain my story and I'm transferred to the fraud department. Explain my story again and I asked for someone to look at the circumstances surrounding my loan and see if they could pull my credit report now and offer me a better rate because I still have 5 years to pay on a loan that I already paid double and my diploma is obsolete now. I can't even use it to get a job in the medical field. They won't budge and will not help with that so XX/XX/XXXX the fraud department said they would send me a package to fill out and send back in. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Navient saying they reviewed my identify theft and forgery dispute and have concluded the information provided is accurate, At this time I haven't received the package yet. What are you verifying if I haven't given you the details yet? Because Navient is both my servicer and lender I don't feel I'm going to get a fair investigation. The school took this loan out on my behalf without explaining any of the terms. I would have preferred a federal loan with a fixed rate and I wasn't given that option. No student aid was applied for, no grants. Nothing The paperwork provided with the promissory note says variable interest rates are determined by the prime rate and your credit score. If my credit was so poor then, that this company is charging me 10 % + higher a month why would you not go with a fixed loan? again I remind you, the private loan was obtained before exhausting all federal options.",Loans,1,0

"Ever since my XXXX student loans came due in XXXX 2015, Wells Fargo has consistently misapplied my full amount payments to only XXXX or XXXX of the loans, and then charged me late fees for the remaining balance. This has happened whether payments were made in a branch, through the app, or over the phone. By the time I discovered these mistakes made by Wells Fargo, late fees had already accrued. These late fees have not only caused a lot of hassle, they have also caused significant drops in the credit scores of both me and my parents, because when these "" accidents '' are made, and account are mistakenly shown as past due, this information is then forwarded to the credit reporting bureaus. 

Additionally, because over XXXX loans, my interest averages out to a little over 10 %, I applied for a modification in an attempt to lower my monthly payments of {$890.00}. I was informed that, along with my parents as cosigners, we made too much to qualify for a modification. We then went through the process of applying for a student loan consolidation. After Wells Fargo lost my parents ' submitted information multiple times, we were finally denied the consolidation by receiving an email informing me that I still required a cosigner to qualify. When I called to ask if this was a mistake, as I had submitted my parents ' information multiple times, they informed me that, between my parents and I, we did not qualify for a consolidation, not only because our credit scores had dropped ( in no small part due to misreporting accounts as past due, when they had, in fact, been paid ), but because we did not make enough. 

As of this morning, I received an email from Wells Fargo informing me that I was past due on XXXX of my XXXX accounts. This last month, in an attempt to avoid any issues with Wells Fargo for the first time in over a year, I made my payments two weeks early, through the app, and paid on each account separately. After a fifteen minute phone call, I was informed that, once again, a mistake had been made by the app, and the payments were only applied to XXXX of the accounts. The person I spoke with assured me, as I have been assured every month for the last fourteen months, that a flag would be placed on my account so that a person would manually make sure that my payments would be applied correctly. 

Wells Fargo has just settled with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misapplying student loans payments so that they could charge more late fees, even when payments have been made properly. At this time, I currently have an outstanding balance of {$88000.00}, with {$220.00} in late charges.

Calling Navient is a stressful experience and calls can last at least 45 minutes sometimes ( including time on hold ), so it was and is still not easy to follow up when it seemed like they are not applying my extra payments to my principal.

The term of the loan began on XX/XX/XXXX when I received that money into my bank account.

"I have used Navient formerly XXXX XXXX to service all of my private loans. I was forced to take a forbearance because my loans had become delinquent as I was not financially stable to make the payments. This led to years of nonstop phone calls and hardship on my credit, which filtered out into other aspects of my life, ie : high interest rates on car payments, not getting approved for credit cards, etc. I have diligently pushed myself as a single mother of XXXX to rebuild my credit so I can provide a brighter future for myself and my children. I have worked feverishly to make all my payments on time for the past 3 years, however I have only been able to pay towards the interest of these loans. It has only been since XX/XX/2016 that a small fraction of my hard earned money has begun to be put towards the principal of the loans. It is a constant worry and stress on myself and my family thinking of how long it is going to take to repay this debt. Forcing someone to choose between being able to feed their family or make their student loan payment is cruel but sometimes a harsh reality. A little consideration and help can truly go a long way for someone who is struggling and does n't always have the means to make ends meet.",Loans,0,1

The payoff on my account the beginning of the week for XX/XX/XXXX stated my payoff was about {$2500.00}, the GAP claim paid {$2400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX.

"On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to purchase digital gift cards from PayPal using my PayPal account balance. I attempted to purchase several gift card sets and received the following error message : "" Sorry, we can't complete this purchase at this time. Please return to merchant and choose another way to pay.

I can only describe this level of service as terrible. PayPal can not provide any insight in to why the transactions are being blocked.

I was then received an email from Paypal stating that I reported my payment as unauthorized and that I set up a dispute caseit even stated that I made a comment about it being a spoof claim. I did none of these things. And because a dispute case ID was created in error, I had no access to my funds. That payment was due the day that I sent it.

"I like to start by stating my complaint is with the company Coinbase, which is a bitcoin wallet. On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX XXXX  after having to replace my phone device I attempted to sign onto my Coinbase account. I was able to enter my user name and password correctly but as a secondary precaution Coinbase also requires the use of an authenticator code. However, with the replacement of my phone I lost access to my authenticator app. Not having the required authenticator code there is an option from Coinbase to submit a license and selfie to gain access to my account. I have attempted to gain access using my photo and ID over 11 times with a denial every time. I reached out to Coinbase on XX/XX/XXXX via phone and was told to keep trying that there was nothing else they could do. I reached out again on XX/XX/XXXX where I was told they were investigating the issue and working with a specialist to address it properly.

"Date XX/XX/XXXX Complaint against XXXX and Citibank Home Depot credit card giving invalid confirmation numbers for unauthorized External Wire Transfers and XXXX XXXX for not verifying accounts were in my name : I have learned this type of fraud has been going thru since XXXX, how is it possible that banks cant identify these scams from there inceptions. 

I am a victim of banking fraud through unauthorized wire transfers by scammers who posing as potential employers beginning XX/XX/XXXX. The scammers used stolen identities via other people 's banking accounts to pay me for goods totaling {$52000.00}. These purchases of which {$33000.00} was through XXXX and the other amounts of {$18000.00} was through a Citibank Home Depot credit card. 

I was told by the scammers the accounts were in my name through a company business account setup to pay for goods they were paying me to buy. I believed that the payments given by the scammers were valid after testing the first {$1000.00} in XXXX. I proceeded to make more purchases with the information to wire transfer payments from company account to my account through accounts given. 

Based on the confirmation authorization numbers XXXX Bank and Citibank gave me for every payment transfer transaction it confirmed that the business account was valid since I was told this was a company business subaccount in my name. The XXXX bank contacted me by XX/XX/XXXX ; well past 30 days, after the stolen payments paid to me for the goods began returning as unauthorized transfers as of this time XXXX had authorized {$26000.00} and Citibank {$18000.00}. By the beginning of XXXX after purchases of goods were completed and all invoices paid off. Except the last purchase for {$7900.00} which would have marked the end of my so-called probation time with the scammers the total purchases was {$51000.00}. The company was to let me know if they would hire me, it was at this time payments the banks confirmed valid began returning as unauthorized. The timing of these payments returning makes me believe that the owners of the stolen banking information may be involved in the scam. 


In XXXX, XXXX after sending many resumes looking for work, a person name XXXX XXXX contacted me who I believed to be a legitimate employer this individual claimed to be a recruiter for the company. I filled out an application to be possibly employed after what they called a probationary time. They claimed an evaluation for employment with them would be completed after they see how well I could purchase and ship goods based on their specifications. They said they would pay for my purchases and shipping cost which they did via External Wire Transfers of funds. 

They asked me to fill out an application for information that a legitimate employer would and I being skeptical did an online search of the company on link they provided with the responses showing the company to be at least at the time a valid entity on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX. This however turned out to be false and a fraudulent company which I found out after payment funds returned and I purchased and shipped the goods. They reimbursed me for all my expenditures from what I have learned were another persons stolen bank account funds. 

The problem with all these transactions lies with three banks, whose job it was to flag the fraudulent transactions before they ever approached paying my account. Because the banks began paying, it aided the scammers to increase purchases to a current total of {$52000.00} which has overdrawn my credit limits. 

By the end of XXXX all fraudulent payments had been returned unauthorized. Failure by these banks XXXX, Citibank and XXXX XXXX XXXX the bank where all the accounts were stolen from by the scammers ) began when they allowed many supposed external wire transactions accounts funds purportedly in my name as claimed set-up by the phony import/export company, into my personal account. One bank explained to me that they pay on the bases of blind trust that the payment may not be fraudulent. They didnt verify who the account belonged too before giving a confirmation number and transferring the funds to my account. 

Therefore after my first {$1000.00} that XXXX XXXX sent me for payment with a confirmation number XXXX and Citibank confirmation number XXXX ; here lay the first problem because, I believed they verified the account holder name was a business account authorized with my name. The bank confirmation meant to me that it was a valid account and I proceeded to make more purchases because it indicated that the scammers unauthorized bank transactions were valid. 

The phony import/export job I was trying to get hired for, as I have learned had some XXXX XXXX XXXX man, from Florida, and a dental office as the actual stolen bank accounts holders for XXXX XXXX   phony company transfers. I was told it was a dental office that alerted the bank, a month later that banking information had been stolen. 

If this were the actual case, then when XXXX XXXX and Citibank, contacted XXXX XXXX about external wire transfer funds from ; a supposed account set-up in my name by phony company, the account should have been automatically flagged as a suspicious transaction, with both parties, I and account holder being notified. 
XXXX and Citibank have paid my account on as stated by Citibank on XXXX trust before verifying, had they did their due diligence to verify the persons name ( s ) on the external wire transfer account they would have seen the very glaring problem that the account number and names do not match up and stopped this scam immediately from progressing. 

If these banks are willing to take these types of risks with my accounts then I the XXXX consumer should not have to bail them out and pay. The problem is the bank only wants to focus on the purchases ; I made only because of their confirmations, and not consider the stolen bank accounts that they gave bogus confirmation as valid, which then allowed bogus payments to overdraw my account this cant be ignored. 

Bottom line is banks should have put a hold on the transactions until they could be verified. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX told me they were investigating, however ; nothing was done and instead he waited for all phony payments to be returned then told me I have to pay the bank. XXXX XXXX has locked me out of my saving stating they are allowed to take all my funds to pay in addition they have began billing me for the fraudulent funds that have overdrawn my VISA account also sending me past due notices that payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore I have no access to my account however they are telling me to pay. I had to borrow from my IRA and pay penalties for early withdrawal to have funds to pay for my living expenses. 

Status of accounts : XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX told me to pay all the funds, he began billing me for the funds sending notices that payments are past due, plus has locked my saving account stating he will remove my saving for payment. Hung up the phone when I told him its not my fault they allowed my account to be paid with stolen money. 
Citibank XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX # XXXX ( refuse to give last name only a number ) Hung up. 
Citibank XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX # TMY ( refuse to give last name only a number ) said they will freeze my account and begin an investigation. 

XXXX XXXX : Has returned all external transferred phony payments after XXXX to XXXX and Citibank as unauthorized. 
A typical personal check takes about 3 days to verify, shouldnt money transfers be a point to point transfer bearing the names of all parties involved. 
The question is how is it they all failed to flag these transactions as phony from the start if my name was not on the account I was transferring from as verification to XXXX XXXX. It was only until the account owner notified the bank that they determined accounts were stolen. 

I believed how external wire transfers work is they ( the Bank ) verifies both parties sender and receiver before confirmation of payment. Based on what happened this was not done with my case and as a result my credit balance is overdrawn, my credit cards are frozen and my life saving account I was told will all be taken by XXXX. 

I should not be responsible and my credit history ruined if these banks allowed these types of transactions and did not provide warnings/alerts and true/real account confirmation verifications for my and their clients protection. 

Because these banks confirmed unauthorized transactions as valid these scammers were aided and allowed to continue. I am therefore requesting that my credit history status be restored at all credit agencies, all overdrawn balances and fees be removed from my account at XXXX to date total {$34000.00} and Citibank {$18000.00}. Lastly my saving account balances be restored at XXXX   bank. 

I am very concerned that my credit will be destroyed because these banks allowed these fraudulent money transfers and seem to be doing nothing relevant to prevent it. 
In reality I received stolen money VIA wire transferring as payment to pay for purchased goods, shipping fees and other expenditures, its my account thats overdrawn- only banks have the job of verifying accounts- Im the victim because the bank didnt verify that the account information were stolen. 

Im therefore seeking help to restore my accounts and credit history since I believe these banks may have broken with banking rules/federal procedures for money transfers to the tune of $ XXXX.

"There are two issues with regard to my complaint about Coinbase Inc. based in XXXX XXXX, CA.
First, not exercising due deligence as promised by the company to protect the financial well being of the customers. This includes locking my account, and not being responsive to my numerous voicemail and email requests to resolve the issue. As a result, this has inhibited me from taking adequate action to protect my financial situation against recent too volatile digital currencies movement.
Second, not depositing or otherwise rejecting the fund I transferred from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account to my US dollar wallet account which is stored on coinbase platform ( {$8000.00} ).
The story : I opened a coinbase account and slowly started buying digital currencies ( BTC, ETH and LTC ) using my checking account and credit card. I excecised extreme caution in my new venture. On XX/XX/XXXX, I transferred {$8000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account to coinbase account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. The fund was supposed to be available in my US dollar wallet at cointbase account within 3 days. The XXXX XXXX XXXX  even confirmed that XXXX XXXX XXXX  received money on XXXX XXXX, 2017, but as of now (XX/XX/XXXX ) they have neither rejected nor deposited the fund. I contacted their bank but it did not avail me. As I mentioned, they lack a responsive customer support line.
Most importantly is the incidence that occurred on Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2017. I  made an attempt to sign up to XXXX XXXX, which is part of Coinbase Inc and is maintained by them. I used a different password than that used for my main coinbase account. I also used XXXX Authenticator required by Coinbase Inc as part of the sign-up process. I never scynronized my XXXX account with my wallets at Coinbase Inc. Within 2 minutes after my sign-up, I decided to log in to my main coinbase account, only to find that I could n't log in. I checked my email and found a notification from Coinbase that my password had been changed. Having thought that my account might have been compromised, I requested that my account be disabled by clicking on the safe link they had provided in the email. I also sent them an email to report the incidence. They got back to me the following day asking for the reason for my request!, and informing that my account would remain disabled until I confirm my password, email, and 2-factor security codes are secured. I have sent them numerous emails, and left them voicemails at their number at XXXX, but no responses yet. My account excluding the above {$8000.00} is worth around {$25000.00}.
This incidence may simply have been caused by my main coinbase account password being replaced by my XXXX sign-up password, a situation that I should have been warned upon XXXX  registration.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",1,1

"Complaint against Wells Fargo BankOn XX/XX/2015, I had a cashier 's check for {$2400.00} transferred from my Wells Fargo Account to another Wells Fargo account in another state. Fifteen minutes after the transfer. I discovered that this was a scam. The scam involved my granddaughter going to school in another state, being involved in an auto accident, and needed money immediately to get her out of jail. My granddaughter was supposedly in the accidentXXXX, so her voice at the other end was sounded like my granddaughter. I was still in the bank branch when I was made aware of this scam immediately by hearing directly from my granddaughter that she was well. I notified the bank manager immediately. He checked the account and noticed that it was a cashier 's check that was to transfer the funds. I was told that the funds would not be transferred until midnight. I also discovered that the scammer 's account was only opened up 2 days prior to the scam. The bank manager had me obtain a police report and when I returned, he called the fraud department at Wells Fargo and a hold was placed the scammer 's account on that date. The police told me that this type of scam was well known to them and that account will be closed after the funds are deposited. The hold on that account was in place until today XX/XX/XXXX, when the scammer closed the account and a cashier 's check was mailed to the scammer. The bank told me they had to send the funds to the scammer when the account was closed because they would be concerned of a legal quagmire from the scammer. 

I have been checking with the bank branch, almost daily, to find out the status of the claim that was filed by the bank manager with the Wells Fargo bank fraud department. I have been a customer with Well Fargo Bank since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never had a problem with Wells Fargo before. I feel that the bank dropped the ball and did not do what it is required of a bank with a claim that was filed. I doubt if the claim was even investigated. If I did not call on a regular basis, I would get a progress of their investigation of my claim. When I found out about the check being sent out, I called the Wells Fargo Executive Office and complained about this action. I feel that Wells Fargo is liable for sending out the funds and did not notify me properly of the progress or the results of their investigation. I also do not believe that Wells Fargo did anything to protect me as a customer and I am filing a claim about Wells Fargo under the Regulation E.

"Paypal / XXXX has accepted and listed my bitcoin products to be sold on their website on the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
My item was listed as NON-REFUNDABLE as it is a digital currency, after being sent to the buyer, the transaction can not be cancelled/reversed. 

I listed for a total of XXXX $ in digital currency. 

Every buyer ( 6 in total ) contacted me personally by message on ebay to provide me with their Digital Wallet address ( like an email address, to send the digital product ). After getting confirmation of purchase from ebay, paypal and the buyer, I proceed to send the bitcoin. 

The next day, I received emails from paypal telling ALL ( clear pattern here ) buyer report an 'Unauthorized Transaction ' saying their accounts were hacked.
I am not responsible for ebay/paypal ( same company ) having their data leaked and making it possible for  hackers to scam and extort sellers like myself so easily. 

Paypal has closed my 'Dispute case ' in favor of the buyer. At this point I have lost my product, and they are asking me to refund them. In other words, I have lost XXXX $ worth at the moment of product, and now they are asking me XXXX $ to refund the buyers. 

It is a common discussion online that buyer are abusing XXXX/paypal policy on refunds in order to steal digital products. Buyers simply have to claim they have been hacked. This seems to be what is happening to me and my business. 

Paypal / XXXX is responsible for their security leaks, they market their products as 'PayPal is the faster, safer way to send money, make an online payment, receive money or set up a merchant account ' but clearly they are extorting buyers from their products and money in favor of hackers / scammers.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,0

"I found a snow mobile that I was interested in, which was located in XXXX, a city located in XXXX. I contacted the seller of the snow mobile and we exchanged conversation over the next week or so about the product, and purchasing it. The seller wanted me to wire him the money ( {$5000.00} ) but I did not feel safe buying something in another country by just wiring funds. I requested him to send me an invoice via PayPal as I assumed that PayPal was the safest way to make the payment in the event there was issues I would be protected and can easily file a dispute with PayPal to be protected. He was n't happy with receiving PayPal as a form of payment, but he did send me an invoice of {$5200.00} as I instructed him to so that he has the additional {$200.00} to cover the fees that PayPal will charge to receive the funds. 
After sending payment, I proceeded with trying to schedule my drive out to XXXX to pick up the snow mobile. Being a XXXX hour drive ( each way ) from XXXX OH where I am from, I wanted to ensure everything was in order for the long trip. 
He had told me the town he resided in, but never the exact address. I asked him numerous times, and his response was 'just head up here, I 'll give it to you when you are close '. I did not want to drive XXXX hours to not have an address of where to go to, especially crossing the border incase I was questioned for the drive when pulling a trailer. Within an hour of starting the drive, and insisting I received an actual address, the seller then stated that he either needed more money for the snow mobile due to PayPal fees ( which was incorrect ) or that he needed cash instead. Having already sent him the {$5200.00} which was already deducted from my account, and being a weekend, I was n't able to go and withdraw another {$5000.00}, especially since he had not refunded me the original payment. If he wanted me to bring cash, he could have easily refunded the payment, and I would have been able to reschedule the trip and bring actual cash if necessary. 
Since we did not come to terms on the purchase, I decided to turn back around and head home. 
Once I returned I asked him to issue a refund, which he ignored. I asked numerous time, stating that I would file a dispute with PayPal if he had not refunded me, which he also ignored. 
I file a dispute, later escalating it to a claim. The seller attached a tracking number in his answer to the dispute filed, and upon receiving the box that he had sent and attached a tracking number of in PayPal, the contents of the box were as follows : ( picture of box and contents also included in evidence pictures herein ) XXXX XXXX, bag of XXXX chips, hand cream, toy XXXX wheeler, picture of the sled being purchased inside XXXX XXXX, and disinfectant wipes. 
The claim got turned down via PayPal as they stated that this has to do with the purchase of a 'motor vehicle ' and they do not govern, not does a purchase of such fall under their buyer protection terms. 
I have filed a Police Report with my local Enforcement Agency, as well as made a Claim to the Ohio Attorney Generals Office. That claim number with the Attorney Generals Office is XXXX, filed on XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I wish to file the claim here as this is absolutely a form of fraud this individual has committed, as well as to prevent him from doing so in the future as he seems like someone who will again and again after what seems like he is getting away with quite easily.

"Coinbase has locked me out of my account on their website and I can not seem to get it recovered. Trying to sign in with my username and password pulls up a prompt for a 2 Factor Authentication code texted to an old phone number that I do not have anymore ( I recently changed it and forgot to update it on a few sites online including this one ). The normal process for many websites and 2FA issues is to submit proof of identity, but I am having repeated issues doing this with Coinbase with little effort on their end to help resolve the issue.

After clicking the option that I no longer have the phone number ending in ( my old number ), I am taken to a "" coinbase account recovery '' page that asks to upload my state ID and a picture of myself to verify that I am who I say I am and to recover the account. I am not sure what is wrong with their program, but I can not get the system to verify me no matter what I do. I have taken clear photos of my ID multiple times with my new XXXX smartphone, and for the picture of myself have used said phone camera as well as a laptop webcam, but no matter what I try to use their system refuses to accept the valid ID and photo of myself and will not recover my account. 

After this, I tried contacting Coinbase customer support through an online field submitted to them, detailed with this information that I no longer have my 2FA phone number, that I can not sign in to my account, and that their recovery systems are not working and put in a request for another way to verify my identity and recover the account, such as sending a copy of my social security or birth certificate, for example, or having a support agent personally check the ID and "" selfie '' online if their automated system is having issues.

I received an email from Coinbase Support within two days after, with what seems to be a canned response. It simply lists the steps to start an account recovery process using the automated method that above I stated is not working, so this was not helpful in recovering my account, as well as a few "" tips '' for a successful validation that did not work for me. Furthermore, I was hoping to respond to this email with a further request for something to be done as this did not help me get my account back, but I have no further way to respond to the support ticket filed. The link in the email to follow to view the ticket status and add comments, etc does not work, clicking it simply redirects to the general support FAQ page.

The fact that I can't recover my account in a timely manner isn't even a big deal, what's frustrating is that their recovery systems will not work even though my identity is accurate and true on the ID and photo submitted, and when I inquired on why it wasn't working and how to get my account back if it wasn't working, they simply sent a canned response and won't even give me a method to reply back for a different solution.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,1

"My ex-wife and I separated in XXXX. In the process, my mortgage loan was modified by GMAC beginning XXXX XXXX. Shortly afterward Ocwen Loan Servicing took over.

In XXXX I began the process of attempting to have her name removed from the mortgage with Ocwen. Ocwen began "" reviewing '' the assumption package XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I have continued to supply Ocwen with responses, paperwork, forms, documentation, and whatever else they requested since. I was traveling during XXXX of the times I was requested to provide documents and it took approximately XXXX weeks to honor that request, but most times I provided whatever information requested within XXXX days ; sometimes within hours. 

From approximately XXXX XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, Ocwen had an "" internal issue '' in their FHA underwriting department. This issue brought the entire assumption process to a halt. I find it difficult to believe that Ocwen could not or did not write a single FHA loan during that time. 

My income alone is higher than were mine and my ex-wife 's incomes combined when this loan was originated. My income is higher than it was when this assumption process was initiated nearly XXXX months ago. My debts are lower than they were when this loan was originated and they are lower than they were when this assumption was initiated - by nearly $ XXXX/month. 

I am, and have been, paying as agreed since the modification of this loan in XXXX XXXX. I have not been late. I have not missed a payment. I have paid at least the full amount and as a matter of fact have paid extra for several months. 

My ex-wife has grown impatient with this process and has filed contempt charges against me. Because of Ocwen 's failure to execute, I might very well incur legal problems. As a result, I have begun applying for another mortgage loan with another provider. If Ocwen continues to fail and I am required to obtain a loan with another provider, the terms of the loan will be different from my current mortgage.

If it was n't for my family help, I would not have been able to continue to file for the home modification and escalate an appeal. I wanted to arrange payment arrangement, but BOA wanted to make payment arrangement of monthly mortgage + back pay divided in 6 months payment ( I asked for smaller payments and they refused ).

"This complaint is long overdue. I am a resident of XXXX XXXX, PA. I refinanced an existing 1st & 2nd loan that my husband and I had with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was supposedly my new lender and PHH Mortgage Servicing was to service both loans. 
The 1st piece was a interest only1.2m10 yr ARM and the 2nd was a XXXX heloc. The 1st piece was securitized into XXXX XXXX. Unbeknownst to me, there was fraud in the origination, closing, recording, transfer and the servicing of the loan. I only began to discover the true nature of the transaction and the improper activity surrounding it after I became the victim of an engineered foreclosure by PHH Mortgage Servicers starting in XX/XX/XXXX. Summary judgement being improperly ordered in XX/XX/XXXX. 
The institutions involved are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX ; PHH Corp., /XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX XXXX , XXXX., ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Some of the various addresses of the institutions include XXXX, Fl., XXXX XXXX, NJ., XXXX , MN, XXXX, NY, XXXX & XXXX County , PA . 
The loan # 's are available upon request. 
XXXX XXXX/XXXX, PHH Mortgage Corporation and its affiliated entities improperly force placed insurance on my non escrow mortgage loan several times from XX/XX/XXXX to current. They forced escrow increasing my mortgage payment by thousands of dollars. They also improperly paid property taxes when they were already being paid. They were refunded monies from the  county and the insurance companies and never properly credited my account. I was forced to pay over {$80000.00} in false escrow arrearages under threat of foreclosure when they were already reimbursed by the reinsurer, XXXX & XXXX and the county. Even though I was paying for my own private homeowners insurance as well as my property taxes. At the same time, our eldest daughter was involved in a XXXX auto accident XXXX XXXX XXXX and rendering her XXXX XXXX. She had the same XXXX as XXXX XXXX and required lengthy and expensive XXXX. Not only did PHH not respond to my requests for help during this horrific time, but my innumerable calls and requests to correct their records were ignored and they finally engineered my default because I finally refused to keep paying unless they correct their records and accounting and properly credit my account returning my mortgage payment to the original amount. Little did I know, this was their business plan even before the loan closed. PHH filed foreclosure. I made a time sensitive cash offer to pay the loan in full thru an attorney. They ignored it and without my knowledge both PHH counsel and my counsel removed me from the XXXX County diversion program while I was still in the midst of negotiations. A default judgement was entered erroneously stating that my counsel did not make an appearance ... which he did. I fired my attorney and then was forced to represent myself pro se. During the process, I uncovered frauds that I could never have even imagined with complicity at all levels in the origination, recording and servicing of the 1st loan as well as the 2nd. There was never a trial. I lost in the lower court and unsuccessfully appealed to the Superior as well as unsuccessfully petitioning the Supreme Court in XX/XX/XXXX as a pro se appellant. Unncovering even more frauds all the while. I then was forced to file an Individual Chapter XXXX bankruptcy to stay the sale of my family home. I was included in the XXXX XXXX class action againest PHH and opted out in XX/XX/XXXX hoping to preserve my right to pursue a private right of action, which I haven't been able to do yet. My BK attorney refuses to file any objections to the PHH POC even though it is full of errors and misstatements to the tune of {$400000.00}, as well as fraudulently fabricated allonges. He is forcing me to negotiate with PHH by threatening to withdraw from my case, postponing evidentary hearings, not filing monthly reports and refusing to communicate with me despite the sanctionable actions by opposing counsel in the POC.

InXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX reset/raised my escrow payments up around an extra {$250.00} a month creating a hardship as my mother and I are on a fixed income ( part of this was {$100.00} extra just to "" pad '' the escrow account ). My monthly payments increased from {$1100.00} a month to over {$1300.00} a month. I missed several payments and I filled out a Request for Mortgage Assistance ( RMA ) with XXXX XXXX XXXX in an attempt to perhaps get a repayment plan or forbearance or other assistance. XXXX XXXX XXXX mentioned a loan modification ( which would not be in my best interest as my adjustable rate mortgage rate was 3.5 % at the time ).
XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me multiple letters requesting more documentation and I complied with these requests before the expiration dates on the letters. The first customer service manager was XXXX XXXX. Then my account was turned over to another customer relationship manager XXXX XXXX and things really went downhill from that point on in 4 short weeks. XXXX XXXX ordered a valuation of my property on XX/XX/XXXX and I received a copy. My home is not "" underwater '' in fact I have a positive equity balance of over {$150000.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX I listed my property for sale because I do n't wish to deal with XXXX XXXX XXXX or Selene Finance as I have not been treated fairly. I believe both companies have discriminated against me because of my XXXX and not made any type of acommadation as required by the American with Disabilities Act ( ADA ). I am current on my mortgage and it is my intention to stay current and sell my house then pay off my loan rather than continue to have to deal with those that would seek to steal/deprive me of my property/assets.

"XXXX XXXX # loan number XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To Ocwen Loan Servicer Re : A More reasonable loan modification where it wont create hardship on our family.

This is in regards to requesting a Loan Modification that is fair and  reasonable for me and my family to make payments that is conducive to what is fair based on everything that has happened in the past with what has been done. Ocwen continues to raise the mortgage and rates that I can not possibly pay monthly in an unreasonable modification. It has been an ongoing issue of telling them why and how we are at where we are, because of several different things that is wrong with the loan as it is. Including not removing the bankruptcy in a efficient quick manner so we may move forward from that we have been strugling with Ocwen to make a reasonable fair modification. Instead the payment continues to increase including the rate which is very unfair to what we were given originally. But instead there is more problems on the loan itself. We have tried to continue to let Ocwen Loan Servicer know that we can not afford the amount of payment to the Mortgage and every time we request for a lower amount, we still get the same amount and more as time goes on. This should have been dealt with back when there was a false bankruptcy placed on my home. I will submit the documents to the false bankruptcy and how it took. Ocwen finally removed the bankruptcy using their legal dept. They wouldnt do anything but told us to remove it ourselves when it wasn't our fault that they did not do due dilligence to let it go thru in the first place. So consequently it placed us in the rears and mortgage kept going up. When we attempted to communicate that the payments are too high. Ocwen still did a loan modification and it was more an excessive amount to where it would create hardship on us to pay that amount. 
We continued to try to let the Servicer know we couldn't afford XXXX that we were requesting to reduce it to around XXXX to not be so financially strapped. They instead raised the Loan rate to an harsh excessive rate of 7.5 percent when initially we had a 2 % on our modification from previous ... the only problem with the modification at 2 % was still a high payment of XXXX. This is not fair for the rate that Ocwen did with us when they redid the loan they changed it from 2 % t0 7.5. And made it more to where it still was a high mortgage payment. I will submit what we have continued to request. This has been an ongoing issue. And I don't understand why Ocwen can't reduce our mortgage payment so we are not financially strapped to pay monthly. We just want a fair reasonable amount. This Mortgage has had alot of discrepancies servicing errors and there are deceptive practices occuring. We should be a place where we are able to live without excessive amount to pay. 
We were in a loan modification with GMAC before Ocwen and Ocwen denies we ever had a loan modification with GMAC. When they received our loan from GMAC a representative name XXXX XXXX was working with us as she was assigned from GMAC. In addition when we transferred over to Ocwen a letter was sent to us stating XXXX XXXX was still my relationship manager when Ocwen took over. I had been talking to Ms XXXX and in the process of gathering information then was told that Ms XXXX was no longer in that program as of XX/XX/XXXX and a letter was sent that I would now have XXXX XXXX who was my new relationship manager working on the modification. I have the letter sent to me from # Loan XXXX/ XXXX XXXX Ocwen . When I called Ocwen to speak to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to find out whats going on, XXXX informed me that she couldn't speak to me about my modification because of a bankruptcy. I was shocked and didn't file a bankruptcy it was a false one filed from XXXX XXXX. The odd thing about this is that Ocwen had filed a foreclosure in XX/XX/XXXX when that should not have happened when I was already working on a modification. This was not right because i have letters from XXXX and Ocwen telling me I was assigned a relationship manager but they still filed a foreclosure when I was working on a modification. Then this false bankruptcy happens from a person ; by the name of XXXX XXXX out of XXXX. review the deed and the clerks name wasnt right too. Ocwen should have recognized and did a due diligence on the deed and bankruptcy as it had a robosigner as well for the notary. The whole documents were wrong names and wrong county clerk and false. So from that we were placed on hold for a period of almost a year. We should have been able to do a modification that would have been conducive at that time. But because of this false bankruptcy we couldn't do anything with Ocwen until they removed it. Ocwen didn't remove the false bankruptcy until XXXX XXXX XXXX and we provided all the documents to prove it was false giving them the documents to the legal so they would remove it as soon as possible for us to move forward. But still Ocwen prolonged this until XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was then finally removed by Ocwen. 
We were finally able to work on a modification. We were still letting them know that we need a more reasonable payment to our mortgage we couldn't help that GMAC filed a bankruptcy as well and made us wait when they filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX with a Bankruptcy everything was on hold from that when we were working on a modification then. So what I am trying to share here is that XXXX and XXXX were virtually on hold for us to move forward on a modification. Even if Ocwen would have worked with us to do a modification in XXXX we wouldn't be at where we are at this time. We would have been able to afford a payment XXXX less then what it is now. Then things prolonged and when they gave us a modification it still was too high. We kept on trying to state all of the facts and the errors that happened. We had been subjected to predatory lending and deceptive practices to the original note.We would not be at this state if we were granted a loan modification when Ocwen took over. We were finally working with a relationship manager XXXX XXXX we told her that it wasn't our fault that we couldn't work on a modification because of the bankruptcy. 
Fast forward til today. We want a Modification that is fair and what should have been dealt with when we had a false bankruptcy from this XXXX XXXX. We are just asking for fairness here. There have been times when we submit our financials and more information is needed. This prolonged process shouldnt be like this. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX we were given a trial plan of making payments of XXXX for the month of XXXX and XXXX. However the problem was they raised the rate from 25 to 7.5 percent ... excessive rate. it was an unfair rate and it didn't matter to Ocwen as it affected us with the payment and the interest on the principle. We told the relationship manager we would do what we can towards working on a less more affordable payment that is fair and conducive based on circumstances we were placed in. The Modification was not a fair one for what rate was placed on us. I will submit the Modification from XX/XX/XXXX. We did that and there after Ocwen did not do anything to work on a lower amount or rate as we had been requesting for a long time now. We did with protest to the amount and asked for the relationship manager to inform them that we need a less amount but to show we would work Loan # XXXX XXXX XXXX with this trial period and then Ocwen work to lower this more. It didn't happen. The modification from prior had a 2 % with the excessive mortgage amount of XXXX was the modified amount from the month of XX/XX/XXXX. And when Ocwen redid the modification two months later they raised the rate to 7.5 percent which wasnt right. but we still had the payment a XXXX dollars less but still high at XXXX. They still were felt like there wasn't much effort to work with us to lower the amount due to all of the circumstances of not being able to do a modification back when it should have been done XX/XX/XXXX when they received the transfer. In the QWR it states that Ocwen received the transfer in XXXX ... but didnt do anything with us til they filed a foreclosure not even attempting to work with us at that time ... But instead it was a false bankruptcy that also kept us from moving foward on the modification. At present, we received submitted our financials to Ocwen again as we had in the past. I sent a letter requesting again to lower the amount do to what had occured. the completed packet was received on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and another on XX/XX/XXXX all was complete they would review and a denial letter was received on XX/XX/XXXX 4days later stating they couldn't give us a loan modification due our payment now would be 25 percent more than what it was originally from which the payment amount of XXXX. There didnt seem to be a complete analysis and evaluation of our loan modification by the quick turn around on a denial letter. I I will submit the false bankruptcy and the police reports from XXXX where we should have been able to do a modification and not be where we are at today. We would then be able to afford to live and pay our monthly payments. 
Our resolve in this would be to work out a loan modification that should have been lowered payment with the 2 % moving forward. The fair market value of the rates should have been taken into consideration.deferring the present reinstatment amount to the rears with already deferred principle would help us and bringing down the interest rate that is lower and fair. There wasnt a consideration to truly review and analyze what can be done. We would be able to afford a mortgage payment on the principle amount of {$500000.00} amount with a lower payment and percentage rate lowered considerably ... which would be fair, especially when the XXXX was deferred and the present reinstatement amount added to the deferred amount would help with getting a reasonable loan modification that would not place us in hardship. 
My daughter in law XXXX XXXX is a XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran and this is already dealing with XXXX more XXXX. She is presently submitted for a XXXX XXXX and this would be devastating to her if we were to not have our home. We are asking Ocwen to please do the right affordable thing for us. We didn't do all that was done to our home loan. There is alot of discrepancies and errors and Ocwens motto is helping homeowners is what they do. Then why are we still being gauged by such a high interest rate of 7.5 percent when a few months earlier on a modification it was at 2 % the modification was redone and then Ocwen increased the rate to 7.5 in a matter of a few months. That was not fair. I will provide documentation in the modification that was at 2 % .. We could have had a modification back when our loan transferred to Ocwen . I will include all information as to the continued letters we sent and still have a high mortgage payment. 
We need a more affordable fair one that will keep us in our home. XXXX to XXXX we can be able to afford if Ocwen can do the right thing. The rate is too excessive and is not fair. I have lived here since XXXX and my husband past away and we lost the business when the market crashed. I just want to be able to live without having to struggle. I feel Ocwen can adjust the mortgage to make it right and fair for me and my family to live without worries. This has to be addressed on lowering the payment and as they had it before at 2 % how can such a Servicer bump up the excessive 7.5 % its not right or fair. I need a more affordable modification that will be conducive and fair. Again i have sent letters stating this and there is no resolve in this.",Mortgage,0,0

"This is in reference to Wells Fargo overcharging my home mortgage account ( # XXXX ) ; furthermore, I originally had a mortgage loan with XXXX XXXX ( Wachovia ), then Wells Fargo took over Wachovia and changed my home mortgage account to a home equity loan.

Incidentally, I have always had insurance coverage with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, since XXXX XXXX, XXXX with no gap in coverage ( see attached letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX ).

Finally, we received approval for a deed-in-lieu from PNC Mortgage and PNC Bank, copies attached. XXXX XXXX XXXX then approved and issued a proposed deed-in-lieu agreement ( copy attached ). It requested to we move out in two weeks, which was impossible. When requested to extend that date, we received no response. Due to delay of PNC Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX, we are not sure that date is still available. 
Most importantly, the deed-in-lieu proposal from XXXX XXXX XXXX 's attorneys provided no protection from further personal liability, unlike what my attorney has seen before. The wording in fact stated several times that they could seek any deficiency after they received the deed. In fact, our research shows it is illegal to request a deed in lieu that includes a deficiency judgment in Illinois law, copy attached. 
Points of fact, our sole assets are a government pension, social security and a 401k retirement account. What little cash we have left is from those sources, and it will be used for our move. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX 's attorneys have stated they and their investors required they include such deficiency statements with a deed-in-lieu. In past complaints XXXX XXXX XXXX has taken no responsibility in this matter, stating PNC Mortgage is the servicer. Now, it is XXXX XXXX XXXX and their attorneys who are culpable and need to remove the language that allows a deficiency judgment. PNC Mortgage has not provided decision making contacts. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX purchased the Loan from PNC Mortgage after PNC Mortgage took over the original mortgage as successor to National City Bank. We were never notified of this until XXXX XXXX XXXX issued a summons to us to start foreclosure proceedings. We have been in and out court with the bank attorneys who can not explain the public record, which shows only a construction loan of {$600000.00} ; this perplexed the foreclosure judge. The public record also shows a home equity loan, which were with PNC bank. 
PNC Bank has agreed to defer the remaining balance to {$6000.00} to be paid by PNC Mortgage upon settlement, copy attached. 
The second item stopping foreclosure is that the XXXX XXXX XXXX attorney can not reconcile the amount of the purported final mortgage amount, which is not filed in public record. However, documents provided by the attorney in court show a calculation error whereby the balance of the construction loan was to be increased by the extras added during the construction period. The balance was actually added to the original amount of the construction loan, copy attached. For the years we paid the mortgage we were over charged principal and interest. 
Also attached is a copy of the property record, which draws a picture of the collusion by these banks to structure the paperwork to avoid the property owners and their attorney from speaking of anyone of authority to resolve this situation. In fact, XXXX XXXX XXXX started foreclosure, before there was any record of the mortgage being transferred. The property record from XXXX County Court shows the foreclosure date as XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the property recording of the transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, signed XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( copy attached.

I had an incident where I had a family emergency and got behind. I called to let them know I would make three payments set up two in one month and the third being the second month catching everything up.

"Ocwen refuses to help people still. My husband has repeatedly tried to switch our mortgage payment to the back of the month. Instead Ocwen has refused continuously and without fail to accrue over {$2700.00} of late payments. They are horrendous work with, all calls go to XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX took money out of the wrong bank account, leaving us with a default, and our mortgage not paid that month. This was the one time my husband paid via a real human at Ocwen, instead of the automated phone pay. We were sent an intent to foreclose on XXXX/XXXX/16 certified mail after missing only one payment and the added {$2700.00} of late fees they assessed. This included the overdraft charges that Ocwen accrueddue to this, adding {$93.00} to a late payment of XXXX, costing me another {$160.00}. They have no scruples, ethics, or morals. I took a pension loan and was able to cure the default in XXXX payments before the XXXX XXXX deadline given in the Intent to Foreclose document, & for this they added another {$73.00} of late fees to my account. I called on XXXX/XXXX/16 and asked to be switched to the XXXX. I was switched to XXXX ID # XXXX. I explained to her how I cured the default as I did not want to lose my home, and was calling now about the late fees of {$2700.00} that had been levied against us. My husband is self employed and I myself only get paid twice a month on the XXXX and XXXX. We have been unable due to this to pay before the XXXX, being assessed a late fee each time. Our mortgage payment is larger than one of my bimonthly checks, so it has been a real struggle. The economic downturn has effected my husband 's business of construction. He recently got a job in XXXX XXXX with another company and is doing well now but it has been very difficult for us. We did not want to do a Loan Modification as we knew this would greatly effect our credit and our ability to refinance with another company.XXXX was very helpful and patient with me. It is not her, it is Ocwen that is the problem. She put me on hold several times to try and see if something could be done about the late fees assessed but was unable to do anything. I believe she did try on her own. I needed to even know where to send the late fees since the automated system does not tell you. XXXX tried to navigate that, and said she would put a flag on our account that notifies representatives that any additional money sent in goes towards the fees ( late ) not the principal. At the end of the call she gave me the address of the Research Dept that I could send a letter to explaining my situation and asking for late fees to be reduced. 
I appreciate XXXX she was leaps and bounds above speaking to a rep in XXXX, however, my situation has not been remedied. Ocwen has a terrible track record, the CEO has been forced to step down, all kinds of illegal activity. They refuse to work with consumers really. They want to force you into Forceclosure..1 missed payment that they caused by taking the money out of the wrong account! They send me a letter to Foreclose for this? They add late fees over and over ... They refuse to help mankind. What has really changed at Ocwen? A new CEO? We need real help for consumers. Where was our Bail Out? 

At the end of the day, I want Ocwen to work with me and to greatly reduce the late fees they assessed XXXX hard working adults, that are just trying to survive.

She then stated on speaker phone just have them endorse the check due to them not being current on their mortgage. XXXX XXXX said but they are current, in fact they have given us every payment on time and today they will be giving us the XXXX payment along with the benefit of the doubt that we will honor our permanent mod agreement after we have not given it too them as promised. He was upset. He took her off speaker phone and argued and argued then closed the call and apologized that this what happening and he had no real understanding as to what was occurring. This sent us spiraling in fear that it was all a scam. we left the branch with our check and in panic mode filed pro se.chapter XXXX soon after in XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, after receiving the pro se chapter XXXX notice, only then did Wells without court permission sign the permanent modification documents and return them to us of no value because the pro se chapter XXXX court would have to approve it and they refused to file a motion to do that voiding the modification. Today two years later, we still have the check endorsed by wells and a faulty roof. We have spent thousands of dollars and time sending in correct and qualified modification applications for our HAMP I or even a HAMP II or even a streamline of any kind and Wells Fargo has unfairly denied us again and again with untrue and unfair denials, Please for Gods sake, help us keep our home.

"On XX/XX/2017, I contacted Caliber home loans ( at XXXX ) in regards to my home loan escrow balance and taxes. Let me first start off by saying in order to speak to someone there is a lengthy automated system which has prompt after prompt. Once i spoke to the tax department I then was transferred to customer service. I have an escrow balance of {$3500.00}. My taxes last year were {$680.00}. This year they increased to {$7800.00}. The reason for the increase was due to the fact that we built our home and the previous year taxes were only {$680.00} because the city estimated the taxes without the home and only the land. Upon speaking with a customer service representative ( ID # XXXX ),  he was very confused on the details of my loan which happened the last several times I spoke with Caliber. I asked very clear and direct questions regarding my escrow account : "" where is the money being allocated to and how much ''. He began to say several times "" ummmm ''. He seemed to dance around my question. This is the only info I gathered being that this info is NOT accessible online. Here was the breakdown he gave me and he said he didnt know how else to explain it. The only reason I have any of this info was because I had to ask several times and redirect him back to the original question. 

{$3500.00} ( in escrow to date ) - {$1500.00} ( to insurance ) - {$630.00} ( PMI ) ___________  {$560.00} remainder ... ...?? Where is the rest of the money going?? He got rude as if I was being unreasonable. The call was recorded. I asked to speak to someone else or a supervisor and he then refused stating he answered my questions to the best of his ability. 

I then was transferred by him back into the que after stating that this was a recorded line and i want to speak to someone else. I then spoke with another woman in customer service. This woman could not tell me what my escrow balance was stating "" where do you see that info? "". She then said let me look at the notes from the previous representative. I told her I do not need you to do that. I need you to look at my account and give me direct answers to my direct questions. I explained to her that a portion of my escrow was going towards my taxes and It isnt listed on the annual escrow account disclosure and statement, nor is the breakdown of where the money is being allocated to. She again sounded confused and said I can mail you out another statement. I told her that when someone trusts a company to handle their home loan, they expect direct answers about where and when payments will be made on their behalf and how much. I also told them I would be reporting them for their deceptive practices. I would like them investigated to see why exactly they are unable to give direct answers regarding payments allocated from the escrow account.",Mortgage,0,0

"I want to file a formal complaint against Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. 
We refinanced our home mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX when housing prices were up. Unfortunately, are now in an underwater mortgage because of the real estate market dropping several years ago. We applied for the HARP and HAMP loans, but we were denied because we make our payments on time EVERY month and currently we make enough money to pay our mortgage. We want to eventually downsize, but we ca n't sell our house at the current amount that is owed. I spoke with a mortgage consultant at XXXX XXXX XXXX. He informed us of a program that is a short payoff refinance through FHA. We had our house appraised and it is now valued at {$110000.00}. Our mortgage balance is {$160000.00}. I, along with the mortgage counselor at XXXX XXXX contacted Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC . We explained to them that our house was appraised by a certified appraiser and there is a program specifically for our situation and that Ocwen Loan Servicing does participate in this program. We offered them the amount that the house was appraised at, which was {$110000.00}. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter from Ocwen Loan Servicing indicating that they are accepting the "" Discount Payoff '' for {$110000.00} and it was valid until XX/XX/XXXX. We continued working with XXXX XXXX XXXX by submitting all of the documentation that was requested of us. They had already approved us for the mortgage based on our credit scores as well as our income. Time was starting to run short and so our mortgage counselor requested additional time so that we would have ample time to make sure that everything was submitted to their specifications. Once we requested additional time, Ocwen started sending us letters that the discount payoff agreement was denied. Ocwen never submitted the payoff quote for the correct amount which was agreed upon, but instead they submitted it with the total amount which is currently owed on the loan. Our mortgage counselor as well as his manager made numerous phone calls to Ocwen and they were on the phone for hours trying to get the correct documents so that we could close on the new loan and also so that we could meet the deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. We were told that they would see about extending the date for a few days, but they would not put that in writing. The underwriting team from XXXX XXXX XXXX would not release funds without it being in writing for fear that Ocwen would reject the EFT. Because Ocwen kept transferring us to the wrong department all along and they will not submit the correct paperwork, we have now lost out on this agreement. A few times we were told that we need to talk to the short sale department and we did do that, but they kept saying that we were not approved for the discount payoff, when in actuality, we were. They have reneged on the agreement because of deliberately stalling and not submitting what was asked of them so that we could finalize everything by the termination date of the agreement. I feel they have been very unethical and also unprofessional.",Mortgage,0,0

"Our property taxes were to be paid out by our mortgage company prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Freedom Mortgage mailed out the first check payable to the Sheriff 's Department, the tax bill was overdue PRIOR to the company mailing out it 's very first payment. The first payment would have been {$940.00}. The local sheriff 's department returned the check due to the fact our tax bill was late, placed in collections and Freedom Mortgage was informed at time by our local sheriff 's department of that fact. What does Freedom Mortgage do but send out at least 3 other checks to the sheriff 's department. However they mailed 2 separate checks one for the property taxes themselves and a second one for the penalties that were also now due. Both checks were returned each and every time again due it the bill being turned over to another department AND because 2 separate checks were written it was deemed 'partial payment ' which they do n't accept. <P/>I have called Freedom Mortgage attempting to get this problem resolved on the following dates ( I have called more times than what is noted below, but when I initially began attempting to solve the issue, I did n't record those first few phone calls. ) On approx XX/XX/XXXX Called Freedom Mortgage call Center, spoke with XXXX who assured me she would take care of solving the problem, that she placed our issue marked as "" escalated '', would notify her supervisor to get this taken care of, opened a ticket to help expedite our payment. Even with the escalated request XXXX stated the next check will be processed by XX/XX/XXXX. ( obviously past the XX/XX/XXXX due date ) I also gave XXXX the correct department, the new amount due with penalties accured which is now up to {$1500.00} & mailing address the check needed to be mailed to & that the payment HAD to be all in ONCE CHECK otherwise once again, the check would be returned. <P/>I also stressed that if they delay payment past XX/XX/XXXX the amount due would also be higher than the current bill. XXXX asked me to call & ask to be transferred to the call center and speak with XXXX as the check should have been pushed through by then. She then asked I call her on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and that our taxes should have had the ONE check sent out by then. <P/>On XX/XX/XXXX I once again placed a phone call to Freedom Mortgage, asked to be transferred to the call center & to be connect to XXXX. They said they have several XXXX 's there, they have no way of knowing who I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX. <P/>So this time I get to repeat this whole problem all over again.with a rep named XXXX who 's ID # is XXXX. She pulled up our account, stated the ticket that was created on XX/XX/XXXX had been closed ( which means it 's listed as problem resolved. ). I went through the entire story again to XXXX who assures me that she will open a new ticket, expedite the request, that she will call escrow and push our request through & would make her supervisior aware as well & would place my name "" ON HER DESK '' so when she "" KEEPS TAB '' on our account so she will remember to check the status of our request. XXXX asked me to call back today XX/XX/XXXX as once again, the check should have been mailed out by then. <P/>I called Freedom Mortage again today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) attempted to reach XXXX, no luck.

Who, when pulling up our account did n't have ( or did n't notice ) all the phone calls & requests attached to our account. I explained the issue for what seems like a millionth time. After giving him the info he finally found the information that should have been documented several times over. After being assured that once again our account would be expedited, escrow is in the process of taken care of the payment, I asked XXXX to read me the address that should have already been documented numerous times of where the check will be mailed. Of course, he did n't have that address. Once again, I gave it to Freedom Mortgage. I then asked if it was noted the amount due HAS to be in ONE CHECK NOT TWO and it MUST be received by XX/XX/XXXX otherwise additional penalties would be added. Miraculously XXXX was able to find the most current amount due by XX/XX/XXXX as {$1500.00}. I made it very clear that this problem needs to be resolved ASAP. I also asked XXXX to highlight the CORRECT ADDRESS and PAYMENT DUE needing to be sent as ONE CHECK otherwise we will have to start this process all over again. And, I am exhausted and very frustrated & will not go into XX/XX/XXXX without this being resolved. <P/>This evening, my husband called Freedom Mortgage, spoke to a rep named XXXX who stated the same promises we 've heard each time we have called-it is noted, it has been expedited, escrow is currently working on it. My husband asked to speak with XXXX 's supervisor, XXXX stated that would not be possible. My husband requested that a message be taken & delivered to XXXX 's supervisior and for her to call him as soon as she is available. <P/>This entire ordeal has been very frustrating.

I allowed Citibank a little over 2 months time but no results. 
Thus I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion on XXXX ( see Attachment-2 ) and the customer representative indeed confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion and confirmed that the bonus incentive will be credited to me that very same week.

However Citibank never issued the credit. 

After that, I made multiple inquiries via telephone to follow_up and every time I kept getting told that I will be paid the promotional incentive that week/that month/ etc. 

Please keep in mind that there is also a relatively high monthly service fee associated with the Citigold account and Citibank has been charging me this monthly fee but not yet giving me the Promotional incentive. 

I must reaffirm that the Citigold checking account offer 's terms and conditions were all clearly listed in the promotional flyer and I have ensured to meet all these terms within the stipulated timelines in order to obtain the benefits of this offer. 
I should qualify for this promotion based on the following two reasons : First I respond to a promotion regarding a new Citigold account offer ; apply for it ; get approved by the new account servicing team and I retain/keep a physical printout of the offer disclosures ( see Attachment 1 ) which serves as a proof of eligibility. 
Second I entered the promotional code from the promotional flyer when applying for my Citigold checking account. 
My account was approved and the Citigold new account servicing team informed me ( during the account activation process ) that I will receive the Promotional incentive after I meet the terms during the account reviewing/activation process. 
Furthermore the customer representative has confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion when I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion on XXXX ( see Attachment 2 ). 
Citibank should not take advantage of this misleading marketing advertisement to lure customers to open new accounts.

NOW after there late fee just went through they know I have a {$10.00} charge coming through, so now I 'm going to get charged another {$35.00} late fee because of their {$35.00} over draft fee.

On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I checked my account balance and noticed that my account was overdrawn by {$270.00}!!! I immediately checked the transaction details to find that my scheduled transfers were processed early! I called the Bank and spoke with XXXX. She advised that if the scheduled transfer date falls on a holiday or weekend, the transfer is processed the day before. I asked her to send me a copy of the Terms and Conditions, which I supposedly agreed to, by email. XXXX refused, and told me she could n't do that. I told XXXX that I work at a Bank and I KNOW she can do that. She refused to provide a copy of the Terms and Conditions by email, so I asked to speak with her XXXX. 

XXXX 's XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ID XXXX XXXX in Pennsylvania came to the line and was just as flustered as XXXX! She told me she could email the Terms and Conditions, but it would take 2 days. 2 days for an email sounds ridiculous - I 'm still wating. Further I asked her to read the sections of the Terms and Conditions which addresses my concerns. She read a section but could not tell me which section she was reading from and if it pertained to internal transfers scheduled by the consumer. 

I also asked XXXX XXXX why only three of the transfers took place, instead of all four. She said because my balance was low. Exactly! I explained that the balance in my account prior to any transfer was only {$17.00}, so if that 's the case then NONE of the transfers XXXX amounts {$25.00}, {$65.00}, {$200.00} XXXX should have taken place! She said well MAYBE it 's because I have a certain amount that the Bank allows me to overdraw on my account. So I asked how they determine which transfers to process first. She said it 's the highest amount to the lowest amount. Proves my point again! My largest transfer was NOT processed. Seems management at Bank of Amrica needs additional training. 

Finally, I asked both XXXX and XXXX XXXX to notate my account that I should not be charged any Insufficient Funds Fee because THEY processed a transfer on a date that I did n't authorize, and ultimately overdrew my account. They both refused to add the note and said that I would just need to call back if a fee was charged.

A representative told me I would have to send in my credit card statement to reflect these charges, which I did via e-mail in response to the request within 3 hours on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed that they would process temp credits and remove fee 's once received. 

According to VISA Guidelines and compliance manual They would have had to notify me if there was anything wrong with what I sent in a track able format. Nothing recieved waited a week as fee 's incurred. ( Subsequently, they disabled my online banking so I could not keep tabs on anything claiming there were transfers made via XXXX they needed to investigate for fraud ). 

I immediately called XXXX which I use with 5 banks, their corporate office told me transfers are instant and confirmed and nothing has been reported to them ( only transfers received were my fiance and mom. ) Told that I could not call in anymore and I needed to go to branch for resolution. 

Went into 3 branches, one of which the lady screamed and told me she cant help me and I should help myself. They called the webteam mind you that has a average hold of 50 minutes to only tell me my account is being reviewed for fraud zelle transfers. ( TOLD THEM LETS CALL XXXX OR MY MOM OR FIANCE AND THEIR BANK THERE IS NOTHING TO REVIEW ) This was malicious in attempt to block me from getting access to the XXXX in fees that kept accruing and having to placate or belittle me on the phone. 

Their review was supposed to last 14 days, now 50 days into it still locked out of online banking. 

I called back demanded management and spent another 3 hours on the phone with a guy who finally got XXXX XXXX on the line.

"I deposited XXXX checks via a US Bank ATM at a US Bank branch. An error occurred that caused the deposit to fail. After contacting the XXXX service line due to being outside of the branch 's operational hours, a Reg E dispute was submitted on my behalf, without the process/timelines/potential ramifications of said dispute being presented to me. Instead, I was placed on hold, then advised of what had been done, but still potential impacts were shared. Later in the day, I spoke to the branch manager, who advised me that she had my checks in hand, and stated that a provisional credit would be made the next day when an internal dispute reference code was received. She also indicated that there was a known issue with this ATM due to a customer having deposited cash, which had literally been buried, via this ATM. Since that time, it had not functioned correctly, but was too expensive to replace. XXXX days passed, when I received a call from the disputes team to confirm some details of the deposit, such as if an envelope was used ( it was not ), if the ATM required an enveloped ( it did not - stated that XXXX should not be used ) ... at this point, I explained that the branch manager had my checks, was waiting for the internal reference code, and I pleaded with her to wrap this up so the deposit could be processed.

"Back in 2010 when I was a XXXX in college, I opened an account with Bank of America. They closed my account in less then a week due to what they claimed suspected fraudulent activity. I called the bank to find out what happened and no one could give me a clear answer. They told me the account was closed and that was it. A few month ago ( 5 years later ) I tried to open a new Bank of America checking account, they refused me but the teller could n't tell me why so I had to wait to speak to a banker. When I finally sat down with a banker they told me that I owed the bank {$50.00} in fees they charged when closing the account, fees for which I should n't be paying because I had funds in the account when it was closed. They said that I needed to pay before they can reopen the account, so I asked for my old statements and they told me they ca n't provide it because the account was closed due to fraud. I asked what the suspected fraud activity was because they never told me, they just closed the account without confirming with me and reported me the XXXX. Now if they suspect fraudulent activity on my account should they tell me what it is? Or what went wrong so that I can fix it?

After depositing a {$3000.00} check from my mother drawn on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and another cashiers check drawn from XXXX in the amount of {$3700.00}, still no problems.

I contacted NFCU right away, and they stated that there was suspicious activity on my account.

I was very upset, as I only had {$60.00} in cash and I needed to get items for my children 's schools etc. The young lady I spoke with was very apologetic for the lack of communication and situation with the account. She stated that they needed some addition information in order to release the account. She asked for some information and I provided these within minutes with photos of items requested, attached via emails. I was told that there was an issue with another account I had, that i stated I knew nothing about. She stated that they would need to look into the issue and would contact me within 1-2 weeks. Wonderful! No money and my children and I have had issues with power and other utilities since they did not release the funds to me. Also, I was told that all electronic payments would be returned and all debit card payments would not go through. I was told that if I use my checks, I would be ok. Since I needed food for the kids, I went to a check cashing location and cashed a {$300.00} check. Well, it was returned and I now have egg on my face thanks to that lie. 

Since XXXX XXXX, I have had no t contact from ANYONE at Navy Federal CU. No calls, no postal mail, no emails. I have been sending them emails, ( that they are reading, per my read receipts ) begging them to release my {$1400.00} between savings and checking. I am being ignored, totally ignored. My preferred method of communication is email, they know it and I have received anything from them. 

I need my money released and returned to me asap. The funds in the account are from my mother and the lat money from my husband. I find this situation intolerable and very unfair. I do n't understand what the problem is, and I frankly I do n't care. I have repeatedly asked them to just close the accounts and send my the funds. Nope, no response.

The folks doing this were alleged "" loan officers '' from whatever name they used. I was not happy. Called the bank first to have these transactions reversed immediately. I like to try and pay my bills. I argued at length with the phone reps telling them I was not the one who called in making these claims. I was sure they kept records of there calls, asked them to research. Finally I went to the branch I usually use.

"CHASE Bank 's fraud and misrepresentation, preying on elderly man to direct deposit Social Security for cash bonus and then refusing to honor the bonus promotion. Chase 's bait-and-switch in scamming a senior citizen to route his Social Security income warrants a federal investigation. 

FACTS : In response to a mailed Chase promotion of {$500.00} bonus for new accounts, my daughter helped me, an elderly man on a fixed income, open a checking account and savings account at the Fishers, IN branch on XXXX XXXX 2015. For opening the checking account w/ a minimum of {$25.00} deposit and direct deposit within 30 days, Chase offered a {$300.00} bonus within 10 business days of the first direct deposit. For a savings account with {$15000.00} average balance for 90 days, Chase offered {$200.00}. 

I used my Social Security monthly income for my direct deposit which was credited on XXXX XXXX 2015. It is now XXXX XXXX 2015 and Chase still has not deposited the {$300.00} bonus. Repeated attempts by my daughter via several emails and numerous phone calls with the banker who opened the account, his manager, and the XXXX branch manager have been extremely frustrating and unsuccessful. This is a simple straightforward resolution for a technical problem caused by the Chase banker XXXX who failed to enter the promotion code from the physical promotion mailed card that we brought in to open the account and qualify for the bonus. Now the banker alleges that he does n't recall our using the promotion! My wife opened XXXX accounts using the exact same promotion ( but a different card with a different code ) the day before! In further support of the banker XXXX 's incompetence, when he opened my account, he called my daughter a wk later b/c he forgot to take the signature card we signed and he needed me to bring it back to the bank. 

My daughter who is a joint acct holder has spoken to the Chase banker directly and even to his managers in XXXX, IN, who refuse to correct the problem even after they can see that I satisfied the qualifications for the bonus -- direct deposit within 30 days of opening the account. This has gone on for two weeks! Chase even demanded that I return to the branch for a third time to return something that the banker failed to do -- the promotion card with the code on the back. I brought in the card to Chase bank and they still refuse to correct their error and credit my account the {$300.00} bonus I rightfully earned. 

Chase has misrepresented its promotion, failed to honor its promise of a {$300.00} cash bonus after I satisfied the qualifications for it, and has given me and my daughter the run-around instead of immediately correcting its error. 
Chase employees ' actions which we 've documented are unconscionable and are tantamount to elder fraud and abuse. Chase eagerly changed my Social Security income direct deposit from a bank where I 'm familiar with a false promise that it would take care of my financial needs. But now Chase refuses to honor its promise by crediting my acct for the bonus I clearly earned and no one from Chase will do his/her job. This should 've been corrected three wks ago but Chase and its employees keep giving me and my daughter excuses and promises to follow up and call but then failing to do so. Out of fear, we closed out the savings account b/c we were afraid that Chase would hang onto it for the 90 days and refuse to pay that {$200.00} bonus as well. At my age, I ca n't afford to keep waiting for a bank like Chase to do the right thing and correct its obvious error. 

Chase 's actions are concerning especially with so much fraud and scams targeting XXXX citizens. Chase 's bait-and-switch warrants a federal investigation.",Checking or savings account or service,0,0

"On XX/XX/2017, I opened a XXXX XXXX XXXX checking account with a promotion of {$200.00} for meeting certain qualifying terms. They included a Direct Deposit of {$500.00} OR 10 debit card transactions within 60 days. I met both of these qualifications on XX/XX/17 with 10 debit card transactions in addition to a XXXX XXXX of {$500.00} on XX/XX/17. 

I spoke with XXXX XXXX, a representative who initially opened my account after Union Bank initially opened/closed my account in XX/XX/2017. XXXX XXXX informed me that the account was fully open on XX/XX/2017, that the promotion was indeed tied to the account, and if I met the qualification terms ( Direct Deposit, or 10 debit card transactions ) that I would receive the {$200.00} bonus. 

On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the office of the president ( XXXX ) to follow up on this promotion and why it had not been granted to me. 

Unfortunately, XXXX informed that because the account was "" CLOSED '' I would not receive the promotional bonus. I then stated the obvious, that the account had continuous activity, and that the account actually had a {$25.00} balance. How can the account be "" CLOSED '' if there is a current balance!? 

XXXX then informed me that the terms state the bonus would not be applied if the account is not open and not in good standing. 

I challenge Union Bank to prove that this account was not open and "" not in good standing ''. I did not receive disclosure that the account was ever closed or inactive. If Union Bank 's motivation is to exclude the payout to accounts with zero balances, it should state so in its terms and conditions with something as simple as "" Account must have a positive balance at time of payout ''. 

I believe this is completely unjust and unfair considering the circumstances and how often the account displayed activity. At no point was the account "" CLOSED '' or "" INACTIVE '' as XXXX states. This is an obvious breach of terms considering the way your terms and conditions is worded, and I fully commit to pursuing the {$200.00} for the sake of principle and as a testament to the importance of customer service and transparecy in banking. Especially when it comes to terms and conditions. 

The only resolution would be to grant the {$200.00} promotional bonus as promised in the terms and conditions. At no point was the account "" inactive '', "" closed '', or "" not in good standing ''. These are subjective terms and an account with a zero balance does not necessarily determine inactivity, closure, or good standing. 

Attached are my Union Bank statements, which clearly show the required transactions and qualifications being met per the terms and conditions. In no statement cycle was my account inactive or not in good standing. And no point was my account determined to be "" closed ''.",Checking or savings account or service,0,0

"I have a checking account at TD Bank. I opened the account about a year ago and deposited {$100.00}, which is the minimum requirement so you are not charged any fees. When I received my first statement I noticed a paper statement fee for {$1.00}. Which brought my balance below {$100.00}. I immediately contacted TD Bank and stated the paper statement fee was never verbally disclosed to me at account opening. The banker was very understanding and reversed the paper statement fee and the pending monthly maintenance fee of {$15.00}. I enrolled in online statements as well. These adjustments brought my balance back to the {$100.00} minimum requirement. I received a letter in the mail dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX which stated my account is overdrawn by {$19.00}. At first I thought someone compromised my account and withdrew the monies, but when I called TD Bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX I was informed the funds were depleted due to the $ XXXX monthly maintenance fee that was being charged for low balance. This is the explanation I received when I contacted TD Bank. The paper statement fee was charged in early XXXX, but the reversal did not occur until a couple weeks later, so my balance was not at {$100.00} for the full month. Thus, I was charged the {$15.00} maintenance fee every month since that time. 
When I took care of this in XXXX the Banker told me that I was made whole again with the reversals and enrolling in online statements and I would not be charged anymore fees as long as the balance remained at {$100.00}.

I XXXX  this different offer ( attached 4 ). Apparently, this is not the offer I signed up, and the system messed up with my offer and this offer, and determined not to post the bonus. Theres even no explanation on which requirements were not completed. 

I chatted online with a Citibank agent, XXXX on XXXX ( attached 5 ). Initially he admitted that I met the requirement of {$300.00} and he will find out why its not posted. When I told him about the email regarding a different offer, he said they are the same offer. But he could not explain which requirements were not completed. He said he will ask someone to look into this and reply me within 7 days ( Citibank Service Request # XXXX, Reference : XXXX ). 

Now its been half a year since the transfer of the money, and 10 days since I last contact with Citi. No bonus posted, no reply, no explanation.

"On or about XX/XX/2018, 20 unauthorized transactions totaling {$460.00}, were debited from checking account. After going through the process of filing an unauthorized claim, the bank concluded money can not be refunded because there have been previous transactions in my account history with the same merchant. While I can agree with this conclusion partially ( I did authorize previous transactions to this merchant in the past ), I disagree with the finding because all of these charges in question came from a different IP address than the one listed in my previous account history. If proper researching was done in the first place, it would demonstrate that purchases I authorized my son to make over the course of the past 2 and a half to 3 years ago emanated from a completely different IP address than the one in which these charges originated. In other words, the charges were made by another child who accessed my son 's XXXX account to which my debit is attached without our son 's permission while my family was away running errands from his parent's/grandparent 's home. 

Furthermore, when I allow my son to make charges, they never total to {$460.00} -- - period -- - because an XXXX-year-old doesn't have the means to repay this debt. In other words, we normally allow him to make purchases in the amount in which he can repay immediately. Naturally, the bank requested "" confirmation of cancellation with the merchant, date of cancellation, confirmation number or the name of the person I spoke with ... '' Since these items are irrelevant to my situation, I attempted to further explain my situation to the bank and as of this morning, this matter is still unresolved. By the way, I did ask if this wasn't the proper forum to have my concern addressed, could I be advised as to the proper channel to have my concern addressed. Needless to say, I'm still waiting ... 

My point in all of this? First and foremost, my husband and I don't have {$460.00} to waste on frivolity. As a result of these unauthorized charges, I have and continue to incur difficulties with this bank such as NSF charges that wouldn't normally be assessed if had the money been in the account. My family of XXXX is a single-income home. I became XXXX over 25 years ago, and don't receive any support, such as XXXX, from the government.

After I met all the terms and conditions to obtain the benefits of this offer, the incentive was not credited properly to my account. Thus, I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion in XXXX XXXX ( see Attachment 2 ), and the customer representative indeed confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion and suggested me to wait longer since the incentive should be credited no later than the end of XXXX XXXX. However, Citibank never issued the credit and subsequently claimed that I did not qualify for this promotion which should be targeted to customers who received the promotion communication, even though I do receive the communication and can provide a photocopy of the printout as a proof of eligibility ( see Attachment 1 ). 

I must reaffirm that the Citigold checking account offer was addressed to me and I have met all the terms and conditions to obtain the benefits of this offer. I should qualify for this promotion based on the following two reasons : First, I do receive a promotion communication regarding the new Citigold account offer and keep a physical printout of the offer disclosures ( see Attachment 1 ), which serves as a proof of eligibility. Second, I used the promotional code in the communication to apply for my Citigold checking account. My account was approved and the Citigold new account service team never informed me that I was not eligible for the promotion throughout the account reviewing/opening process. If I was truly not eligible for the promotion, my account application should have been denied at first place when I used the promotional code to open my account. However, I never received an error message nor notification informing that I am not eligible upon account approval. Furthermore, the customer representative has confirmed that I met the requirements for the promotion when I made the first inquiry regarding this promotion in XXXX ( see Attachment 2 ). 

Citibank should not take advantage of this misleading marketing advertisement to lure customers to open new accounts. Please keep in mind that there is also a relatively high monthly service fee associated with the Citigold account and it would take several months for new account holders to meet all the terms and conditions to obtain the promotional offer.

"On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received an email alert letting me know that my checking account was overdrawn. The email was puzzling since I know that I had not purchased any big ticket items. I immediately went to the bank branch where I opened my account to see what happened. This is what was explained to me : My checking account had been charged a series of 'mini fees ' that had been collected through debit card transactions. I asked why would the bank allow the transactions to continue when there was no money in the account? There was a mediocre explanation that eventually led to a requested print-out, by me, of my account. The print out revealed that SunTrust had been charging fees to my account of XXXX for each and every transaction. On some days, my account was charged up to XXXX of these XXXX fees on the same day. I 've been with SunTrust for less than six months, and they continue to, or the employee who opened the account, continues to make glaring errors in relation to my account. How? First, the account was set up improperly. Second, the representative who opened the account did not explain all of my options to me. This experience leads me to believe that there is poor management at this branch location ( XXXX XXXX ) and that the manager, XXXX XXXX is doing a horrible job with both managing and properly training his employees. 
On XXXX/XXXX/16 I left a message at the branch requesting that XXXX XXXX call me. On XXXX/XXXX/16 when I saw XXXX XXXX to check on my account status, he had not even looked into it and explained to me that he had been busy. On XXXX/XXXX/16, XXXX XXXX explained to me that again he had been busy. It was not until that day that he even begin addressing my account. To this day, he has not taken responsibility in the mismanagement of my account and instead is trying to cover up for his employee, XXXX XXXX, who opened my accounts. I believe that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are more interested in meeting their account quotas instead of the care and attention to the consumer. 
When I first opened account XXXX XXXX made a serious error of placing all of my money into my savings account instead of my checking account, as I had requested. This resulted in gross errors that led had to be straightened out when I went to pay my bills ; Certain payments did not go through due to XXXX XXXX 's error.

I, once again, had to be the one following up with him concerning my account. 
A total of approximately XXXX in fees were charged to my checking account ; fees that are both exorbitant and ludicrous seeing the nature of the fees. SunTrust was allowing card transactions to go through whether or not there was any money in the account. I feel that this was an instant payday predatory practice by the bank as they are aware that my paychecks are direct deposited every two weeks like clockwork. I believe that I was seen as an easy target and money could be made from my account due to my direct deposit. I will reiterate that these options were not explained to me thoroughly when I opened my account. My account was set up improperly.

I then made what I thought was an extra payment for {$26.00} on XXXX, from my Cap one bank account online. When on the credit card 's site, I can choose the bank account to pay the payment from. I have a Cap One checking and savings account, and it said the available balance was {$37.00} on XXXX account, and {$46.00} on the other.

Same information was confirmed by XXXX, another rep from the Tennessee office. When the new bill came, I was charged two different amounts, {$160.00} and {$100.00}, as minimum payment due. And then, I reviewed thoroughly the recent activity section and the late fee of {$37.00} was charged, along with {$44.00} of interest on purchases. <P/>This situation has caused me a huge deal of XXXX, as I do n't know what else to do.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,1
"I called Chase Bank back in XXXX to dispute a transaction of a washer that was bought at XXXX online but I had to returned it a couple of weeks later because it was Mal-functioning. XXXX promised me to refund my money in 7 business days and they never did so I decided to dispute the transaction through the bank. I have been a customer with Chase Bank for many years and this is the first time I dispute anything. When I first called they were very nice and courteous and told me not to worry that it was going to be investigated. 1 month later I received a letter considering the charge Valid because of the copies of information that was obtained during investigation and they included in this letter they sent me. The information they sent me belonged to ANOTHER person! They sent me personal information of someone else with a different name, amount of transaction, including their e-mail and all personal information which is a violation of the privacy act, it is absurd how they handled this investigation and sent information that has absolutely nothing to do with me.. they violated Federal Laws. The same week I went to chase bank and told them what their investigations team had done, their investigations team did n't even read the information sears sent to them because it did n't even had my name on that paper which "" supposedly '' validated the charge on my card. 
I sat down with chase banker and showed him all the papers proving I had the right to have my money back including e-mails of the day they picked up the washer and PICTURES that I took when they were taking my washer away on XXXX XXXX at XXXX. After showing the proof the Chase banker was really nice and saw why I was frustrated and that Chase was definitely going to make it right. So he FAXED all the papers and proof that I had to Re dispute because the investigation team did n't do their job right sending me information that was n't even about me. 
After I went there and talked to the banker I was sure that everything was going to be ok. 1 month later, They send me a letter saying that after reviewing with the merchant XXXX XXXX they found that there was no record of return! How do they accept that excuse when I have PROOF that it was returned? I have an e-mail with date and time of the pick up AND I have pictures proving they were there on that specific time taking the washer away from me! They not only took the Brand new BROKEN washer that they sold to me but they also took all my money and do n't want to return what I work SO hard to make. Not only that but Chase reported my disagreement on this dispute to the credit agencies and destroyed my Credit. I had an excellent credit and now it is Fair because I disagree on a dispute that I have been fighting for months because I have been robbed not only by XXXX but my own credit card company.

"XX/XX/18 : I applied for the HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard and received an email response that they would review the application and respond within 7-10 days if they needed addition information. 

XX/XX/18 : I received an email from HSBC asking me to send in proof of my address in the form of a tuition bill, utility bill, or lease agreement and SSA benefits letter dated within 60 days. HSBC provided a link in the email to upload the documentation. I clicked the link and uploaded a copy of my utility bill which had the address that matched the address I put on my application. 

XX/XX/18 : I called HSBC to check the status of the application, was told by the representative that I needed to submit the documentation they requested. I told her I did, she put me on hold, then came back and said she did see that I submitted the utility bill, and I then received an email that I was approved for the HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard and that I would be receiving my card within 7-10 business days. 

XX/XX/18 : I received the HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard. I followed the link provided on a sticker on the front of the card to activate the card online. I followed the activation procedure and successfully activated the card. I then attempted to add the card as a form of payment for a monthly auto-billing and it was declined. I called the customer service phone number listed on the back of the card and after 2 different calls in which I was on hold for over 40 minutes, I finally reached an agent who looked into my account and told me that my account was blocked and the only department within the institution that could remove the block was closed and that I needed to call back between XXXX and XXXX EST the next day. 

XX/XX/18 : I made 2 different calls starting at XXXX EST to HSBC 's credit card customer service department. After spending just over 2 hours total time on hold, I got through to a representative who then transferred me to the department that could remove the block, which turns out to be their "" Security Team ''. I was told by a representative of the Security Team that they could not verify that I own the phone number that I put on my original application and that was associated with my account, even though I was calling them from said phone number and they could see that. The representative said they would not remove the block until they could verify my phone number, and told me that the card had been blocked right after it was mailed out to me. I offered to email her a copy of my wireless phone bill to verify my phone number and the representative told me that that was unacceptable as proof of my phone number and that the bank would, "" conduct its own investigation '' to verify my phone number and that this could take up to 24-48 business hours, or up to 6 business days. I told this woman that this situation was absolutely outrageous. That I had never even heard of a bank blocking a new card before the customer ever even received the card or had the chance to activate it, and then I asked her to please close the account. She said she would not close it because she could not verify my phone number. 

Following this conversation, I XXXX to @ HSBC_US about the situation and was told to email them at the provided customer service email address, which I promptly did. A couple of hours later, I received a phone call from an HSBC representative. I described the situation and she said she could verify my identity by me generating a security code through the HSBC mobile app on my phone and then logging into online banking on the computer with said code. I did as she requested, she verified this, and said she could remove the block. After being placed on hold a few times, she came back to tell me that she needed to contact the same Security Team to ask them to complete the removal of the block. After placing me on hold a couple more times, she said the hold time was long and asked if she could call me back. I said she could and about an hour later, I received a call back from her. She told me that because the Security Team originally said they needed to conduct their own investigation into my phone number that the block could not be entirely removed and that a representative from the Security team would absolutely be contacting me to finish the block removal process within 24-48 hours. 

XX/XX/18 : I decide to conduct some research into the HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard only to discover that a number of other people have experienced the same exact problem as I have. One individual had their card blocked right after it was sent out only to call in and be given the same exact excuse about their phone number not being able to be verified and this person has had the block on their account for almost 2 months now. There are a number of other individuals who have had the same exact problem and have been given the same exact excuse. I have come to find out that HSBC requires you to use the card within the first 3 months to trigger their 12 month 0 % interest promotion. I have come to the conclusion that it appears that HSBC is blocking new cards as they are sent out, and will not remove the block in order to prevent cardholders from using the card within the first 3 months in order to trigger the 0 % interest promotion. Essentially, they appear to be running a scam regarding the 0 % interest promotion in order to entice people to apply for the card, and once they are actually approved, HSBC then promptly blocks the card after its sent out and refuses to remove the block. This, in my opinion, and the opinion of a number of other cardholders, is fraud being conducted by HSBC and is causing undue harm to creditworthy individuals who can verify they own their phone numbers, yet HSBC will not accept proof of their phone number ownership from the customer. 

XX/XX/18 : It is now 96 hours after I was told I would receive a call back from the Security Team within 24-48 to complete the removal of the block on my card, and I still have received no such call and there is still a block on my card. I am now in possession of a card that was issued over 2 weeks ago, had a block placed on it while in transit to me, and that have not ever been able to use. The account showed up on my credit report about a week ago, and the new account along with the inquiry to open the account has dropped my credit score 41 points, and this is because of a credit card that HSBC refuses to close, and I still can not use. 

I would implore the CFPB to investigate this apparent HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard 0 % interest scam in which HSBC is approving customers for the card, then blocking the card when it is sent out, not allowing the customer to prove ownership of their phone number, and all in an apparent effort to keep the card blocked for the first 3 months the account is open in order to prevent the cardholder from using it and triggering access to the 12 month 0 % interest promotion. I am one of dozens, and possibly hundreds, if not thousands of new customers to be a victim of this apparent HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard scam, and I sincerely hope that other US applicants do not fall for this scam and get defrauded by HSBC as I, and many others, apparently have. The bank refuses to close my account per my request, and once again, I am left in possession of an HSBC Platinum Rewards MasterCard that I can not use and that has caused a level of damage to my credit report that will take months to recover from.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,0

My wife and I have worked very hard to keep our excellent credit history and just discovered a delinquency in a Target RedCard account. The timing could not be worse as we are trying for a home mortgage and this small account has devastated our normal 800+ credit score and will ultimately cost us many thousands in increased credit costs. It is our only negative account. 
I just spoke with XXXX at your customer service center and, in good faith, paid off the account in full even though it was already charged off 11 days prior. XXXX and I discovered that an incorrect address was inputted by the Target employee where we applied for the store card and all account mailings were returned to Target as undeliverable. The target employee never asked me if the address was correct and never took my email address when I applied for the card. My correct cell phone was on the account but was never called. I never received a single correspondence or phone call regarding this store card. 
I demand that this charge off/paid in full account be deleted from my credit report. I accept full responsibility for not contacting Target as to why we were n't receiving an account statement but Target never even bothered to call my cell phone to say there was a problem with the account. I am also contacting the credit bureaus to try and remedy this. Please note my Massachusetts driver 's license and the incorrect mailing address that was used to process my XXXX application.

"I have a Chase credit card, and have it for 8+ years. I always pay my statement balance in full, and therefore am never charged interest.

However, on the following month 's bill, my statement said {$820.00} was subject to interest charging. 

I called Chase to get an explanation. They could not provide an explanation, but credited my account for the full amount of interest I was charged. This makes me worry that Chase -- a large financial institution with a history of deception practices -- may be overcharging consumers. I consider my knowledge of finances to be above-average. But I fear that the typical consumer would not raise any issue, and then be overcharged for interest they should not be paying.

I had a credit card with this bank, which I did not pay due to financial hardship.As soon as I had the money to pay my debt I started trying to find a contact number to reach them out. I had lost my apartment and lost a lot of my personal mail, So I had no way of contacting them until I got a copy of my report.I called the number on my report, I called and was told this debt showed as paid on their system, she transferred me then I was told that they could n't give me any information because it had been sold to a collection agency and I had to contact them. I was jst trying to make the payment on my debt and they said they could n't take payment because they could n't even get into the file.They gave me the phone number to the collection agency it had been sold to. I called that number many times, for several weeks. I kept getting a voicemail. Left messages, never received a call back. I called the credit bureaus to try and get a different number, I believe transunion even try calling SYNCB to try and get a new number but they didnt have a different contact number. It was crazy I was chasing a collection agency to try and take care of a debt instead of the other way around.I tried to take care of this situation since last year, XXXX.

I used the money to take care of other debt.I disputed this same account in XX/XX/XXXX because the balance showed on my credit reports as {$1700.00} and according to SYNCB reps. this account showed as paid under their system and they couldnt take payment for it. After the dispute, this bank dcided to update the information and dated as XX/XX/XXXX which affected my credit in a negative way, when I was working on repairing it. I disputed the date to be changed to XX/XX/XXXX which is when I was given that information and tried to pay them, but they did n't and they changed it to XX/XX/XXXX. Which did n't make any sense!

They said they couldnt do that. ANd reported this account anyways. Bringing my score down XXXX points and keeping us from getting a mortgage.

2 ) Macy is not acting in a timely manner. 3 months is too long to conduct their investigation 3 ) We are getting harrassed by Citi Macy collection department. They are discussing personal information with individual who are not on the Macy 's account 4 ) We are working within the confines of the law but Macy / Citi is not.

"I had fallen behind on payments to my XXXX store credit card, issued by XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX in the third week of XX/XX/2018 to arrange for an automatic payment to come out of my checking account and apply as a payment on my XXXX account. I was told by the customer service agent at XXXX XXXX that the amount of {$87.00} would be taken electronically out of my checking account on XX/XX/2018 and applied to my XXXX account. I was told that this payment would reage the account and that I could start making the minimum or more in payments on the account starting on the XX/XX/2018. The money was taken from my checking account automatically, as agreed upon, and applied to my XXXX account. Since making the initial phone call in XXXX, I have been receiving a text every other day and 5 to 10 phone calls a day from XXXX XXXX regarding my account. A voicemail from a representative of XXXX XXXX was left on XX/XX/2018 from number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ext. XXXX. The voicemail stated that I was "" deliberately ignoring the problem of my overdue account '' and "" demanded to get my attorney 's name and number because I was going to need it due to the drastic action she was going to take against me. '' She never stated she was from the collections department, mentioned the payment agreement in my file or said she was from a third party collections agency. I recieved another phone call today ( XX/XX/2018 ) around XXXX from XXXX XXXX and they told me that my account was past due and that it needed to be brought up to date. I explained about the payment agreement put in place by them in XX/XX/2018 and she said that "" she had no idea how someone came to that number ( the {$87.00} to reestablish my account in good standing ), that it wouldn't reage the account and that the payment didn't count. '' I told her that another representative had left a voicemail demanding the name and number of my attorney because they were going to take legal action against me and that I was ignoring my responsibilities, when I clearly wasn't as evidenced by my payment on XX/XX/2018. The representative scoffed and said that "" the voicemail didn't day that and if the other representative asked for my lawyer 's information it was because I had told them I was going through a bankruptcy '' which I told her was not the case. She accused me of lying to her and to "" pay the bank nearly {$200.00} today with her over the phone or she was going to make sure it got taken care of, '' which was even more menacing than the voicemail. I couldn't believe she said that so I told her "" goodbye '' and hung up the phone. In a nutshell, I fell behind by 2 months on a XXXX   credit card issued by XXXX XXXX, called and made arrangements in XX/XX/2018 to make an automatic payment of {$87.00} towards reaching and bringing my account current and would be making another regular monthly payment on the XX/XX/2018. The payment was made, my account was credited but I have since been harassed by 5 to 20 phone calls a day, terrorized with the threat of a lawsuit, calked a liar, been told that my arrangement with them in XX/XX/2018 was invalid and that unless I paid them more money that drastic action would be taken against me.

"Continue to receive calls from unknown company. Has been going on for awhile now. Message left is a different person everytime. You can barely understand what they are saying but something associates. They state that they need to discuss important matter. I call back. The person refused to tell me the company but wanted my name. I gave my name anf continued asking with no response. She then transfers me. This guy refused to answer who they represent, what company. He ends up transferring me. A female gets on the phone. Very rude, nasty, disrespectful claiming they will sue my and follow through with law and the statue of limitations. Still while arguing with me in regards to what this is about. Continued saying I owe XXXX some dollars and will be proceeding to court etc. Claims to be from a debt in 2012. My mom paid bills while I was in the XXXX. As far as I knew all was paid off. I acknowledged at one point having an account with XXXX XXXX but refused to acknowledge if there was an outstanding balance. I have never recieved calls until now 4yrs later. Everytime I ask a question it would not be answered anf back to the statue of limiations. Little information was obtained but felt it was a scam. When she needed to verify my info it was very easy for me all I had to say was a yes or no. Someone could of easily got all the yes and no questions she was asking and by saying yes anyone could of called and acted like me. Not the normal security that I am very familiar with. That was another red flag. It was alot of threats with very little information and was not comforting at all. I contacted the original debt. It was sold multiple times. One debt collector asked what happened. I explained what she was saying and threatening to sue me etc. He laughed and stated well she cant in PA and thats why they are trying to make you pay. He stated he would n't give any money to them and there are alot of scams out there. All while figuring this out I am noting the security things I have to answer. None of which was done by this so called debt collector. They claimed to have sent mail and it was all in the mail that stated very clearly what would happen to me. I asked if it was certified since your threatening me with jail and lawyers etc. She stated no they did n't but it did n't matter our system says you got a letter. So i asked how was it sure I got the letter. They didnt send it certified so it could of went anywhere and considering I recieved no letter. She got XXXX and started yelling at me about the statue of limitations. It was very peer pressuing and unsure what she was talking about. I assume that was the point to try to make me pay but that is n't fair at all amd received nothing in the mail I do n't take phone calls seriously without proper documentation at which they wo n't provide. Some time passed. A restricted number calls me. He was extremely mean, rude, nasty. Stating I had my chance and wanted an address to serve me my paperwork. They already have my address so why would you need my address to serve me. He was pushing for information they already should of had. So way to many red flags.

They have done so for charging interest My balance was just in range of {$20.00} and they have marked my account with credit reporting agencies as delinquent and in debt collection of for debt of {$1.00} ( for 4 months, total of {$6.00} ).

Hello my name is XXXX XXXX and my complaint is against Best Buy/Citi Bank in regards to a Best Buy Visa Credit Card that I had applied for in the beginning of XX/XX/2018. I had made my first few purchases. And then I went to make a purchase a few weeks after that and my card wouldn't work. So I decided to give them a call and inform them that my card has been locked. They told me that my phone number didn't match up to the phone number they had for me on file. They said to wait for a reference number to arrive in the mail in 7 to 10 business days. The letter didn't show up for about 30 days. After I had read the paper and I wrote down the reference number I called Best Buy to give them that number and they said we're sorry to inform you that our verification process changes from time to time and that my account can't be verified. Then I happen to to notice charges on my Best Buy account that weren't made by me and so I called to dispute those unauthorized transactions.The representative I I had talked to decided too dispute all of the purchases instead of the ones I had told him to dispute which in turn prolonged the process. He then decided to cancel that card and issue me a new one. They said to wait another 7 to 10 days for another reference number. When that reference number arrived they said the same thing and it just repeated itself for two months or so. I have most of my current documents that I received from Best Buy along with personal notes that I had wrote along the process that I am going to upload to you guys. If you look really carefully at the account statements they sent me you can clearly tell that it's not accurate something is obviously wrong. This experience made of great impact on my life in a negative manner causing me a lot of XXXX & XXXX which is unacceptable to me and it's not fair. I would like to add that during this time they said that this has never happened to anybody before that they know of and it ended up happening to my girlfriend also but she didn't have any unauthorized transactions. I could go on and on about how this made me feel and provide great detail but that would take forever along with how confusing and complex this has been. I'm gon na provide all of the documents in relation to this complaint to the best of my ability along with a few personal notes I had written during this mess.

"I recently had a credit card charge declined ( credit card company Chase ) and contacted customer service for the credit card company for an explanation. As part of their security questioning to ensure that I was the cardholder, they asked me specific security questions which involved verification of information I had never disclosed to them in the past. For example, in XXXX question ( which had multiple choice answers ), I was given choices for the "" height '' that is listed in my driver 's license number. For another question, I was given choices for the "" profession '' in which I hold a professional license. While I understand that this information is available in the public domain, I find it unethical and disturbing that the credit card company is "" mining '' this information from the public domain and connecting this information to my account. I am happy to answer security questions for which I have provided the "" security answers '' previously, but it is absolutely WRONG that this credit card company ( or perhaps they all do it! ) is allowed to use information I have never given them for security verification purposes. Given the frequency of data breaches in the modern world, having this additional personal information connected to a credit card account gives hackers even more information to be able to steal identities and commit fraud.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,1
"In XXXX I started a company. I had a business checking and savings account with Chase. The business began to make money. Chase offered me a business credit card - just sign here. So I opened card ending in XXXX. There was no attempt to advise me that this Chase business account could - on certain occasion - impact my personal credit history. The business card was reported to TIN XXXX. 

The business held the card from XXXX until the business closed until XXXX. ( See final return ). However I continued to personally pay off the balance of the card after I had moved from XXXX, where the business was domiciled, to XXXX in XXXX. Chase Bank sent promotional offers to my new address. I also received some old business mail, which was forwarded to my new address as well as junk business mail. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was notified by my sudden drop in credit score that my payment on card XXXX was 30 days late. The business card, which had never been reported on my credit history, all of a sudden appeared on my personal credit report. I had no idea what was going on, just that my score had dropped and this was very damaging. 

I immediately called Chase Business Card Services. 

The Chase Business Services Representative told me that if I paid the balance by XXXX XXXX this would not affect my credit and would not move to a new department, which I assumed to mean Collections. He told me that the only instance in which the negative ding could remain on me personal credit history is if the account goes into default. The account was paid in full by the end of the month. See attached copies of confirmation of payment, confirmation of XXXX balance and confirmation of business and not personal account letters from Chase Bank. I have also included the credit reports from the agencies that have failed to delete this entry from my credit report. XXXX has deleted the closed business card ending in XXXX. Unfortunately XXXX and XXXX have not removed this disputed reporting. 

I believe Chase Bank engaged in predatory lending, failure to disclose, not reporting credit card account, demanding payment in full in exchange to remove late payment from being reported on me. They failed to advise me of credit risk before accepting their business credit card. They further obfuscated the risk by never reporting the business card on my credit history - leaving me totally unaware of the risks involved. They misadvised me to pay off the card. They disregarded the law intended to prevent consumers, which only allows for a business credit to be reported personally in the event of a default. I paid the balance of the card off the month I received an alert that my credit score was damaged. By law, this should have been deleted, as I have requested numerous times with Chase. 

I would like to file a report against CHASE CREDIT REPORTING SERVICES to have this business account deleted from my personal credit history. This account was never reported on my personal credit history before XXXX XXXX - over 4 years since opening the account. The terms and conditions binding business credit from reporting and damaging personal credit is not being adhered to, particularly since the card was closed and the balanced paid to XXXX in XXXX. A business payment was missed in XXXX and the account closed and paid in full on the next month, XXXX. This account should not be reported on my personal credit report, based upon the understanding with Chase Business Services and the laws pertaining to business credit only impact personal credit history in the case of outright default. This was not the case. This business card missed payment must be deleted from my personal credit history. This is a case of failure to disclose risk, predatory lending, obfuscation of credit reporting, false statements being made about credit reporting.",Credit card or prepaid card,0,0

"To Whom It May Concern : I am writing this letter to dispute a billing error on my credit card account in the amount of {$150.00} in the form of additional interest from BBVA, the bank card issuer. This charge appeared on my billing statement, dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have enclosed a copy of my billing statement with the disputed charge circled. 
This charge is inaccurate because on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX BBVA incorrectly assigned my account a {$27.00} returned check fee for a electronic funds transfer from XXXX bank ( CFPB can corroborate this as fact via XXXX previous case number : XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX my checking account at XXXX had a balance of {$2000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a pull payment via the BBVA website in the amount of {$2000.00} out of my XXXX checking account into my BBVA compass account using the account and routing #. The payment was properly credited at BBVA Compass on XX/XX/XXXX. 
However on XX/XX/XXXX a full six days after BBVA credited the payment the following transaction details appeared in my BBVA account Description Debits XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX RETURNED CHECK FEE {$27.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX PAYMENT REVERSAL {$2000.00} Despite the fact that my XXXX checking account had the funds ready and available at the time of transfer. Due BBVA being the causation of the {$27.00} returned check fee, combined with my lack of any type of notification of any restriction imposed on the use of the funds in my checking account I requested that BBVA credit my account for the error and BBVA verbally agreed to correct and reverse the {$27.00} charge shortly after it appeared on my account, however curiously BBVA waited until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to effectuate this reversal of the incorrectly assigned {$27.00} returned check fee. I took XXXX 's word that they would expediently correct the {$27.00} charge and paid my entire balance but for the {$27.00} moreover I needed to call BBVA no less than four times and wait almost 2 full statement periods to get this {$27.00} error reversed. Fast forward to the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement and the {$150.00} interest charge arrived on my statement that had otherwise been paid in full before the statement close. I called BBVA to inquire as to how they reached this conclusion on the daily compounded interest calculation however they have refused to provide me with a detailed computation breakdown of how they arrived at the disputed interest charge of {$150.00}. 
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, I am requesting that this billing error be proven, validated and corrected and any finance charges and fees associated with the disputed charge be credited to my account, and for an accurate statement to be mailed to me.

"I made an on line transaction towards lodging in Hawaii. I then immediately noticed that the merchants website did not state if the units had air conditioning in them. So I then proceeded to do a chat on line with the merchant. I specifically asked them if the unit I had just booked had air conditioner or not. I stated to them that if the unit did not have an air conditioning in it, it then posed a health problem for my kids. The customer service representative then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing in the website that identified if the unit had air conditioner in it. So she took my information and told me that she would look into it and get back to me the following day. At the same time I called my credit card company and awarded them of the issue. The credit card company proceeded to assure me not to worry and that everything 's going to be fine. The transaction was n't even posted for them to see in my credit card activity. I believe it took several days for it to finally show up so that then they could begin the dispute process. I continued to maintain open lines of communication with both the merchant and the creditor. The credit company continued to assure me that I should n't have to pay for services not rendered to me and gave me a credit back to my card. The merchant however sat on it and allowed time to be of essence. To the point of lying to me about whom the manager was and pretty much shut the doors on my issue. Disregarding any ownership of lack of information on the website including poor follow up on their part. I contacted my credit company and awarded them of the situation including all lies coming from the merchant. At this point my creditor told me that they would continue with the investigation and again assured me that they where going to take care it. A few months went by and I received a letter from my creditor stating that they had concluded not to credit me the full amount charged due to merchants booking policy 's. I called the creditor and then read the customer statement printed on the back of the statement. That states that if at any time I as a customer am dissatisfied with the charges on my account I have the right not to pay. I read this statement to one of the managers and she then proceeded to refer me to their insurance benefits company/department. She stated that they would be able to help me based on medical grounds that I fit the profile.

"There is a public record entry that was placed on my credit report and I have been trying for over three months to get this incorrect entry removed. I have spoken with numerous representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get this inaccuracy rectified. This is my fourth attempt to dispute this item in which I have not received satisfactory results. 
On XX/XX/2017 I mailed a notice to TransUnion in effort to have the inaccurate item removed or for the credit bureau to produce written documentation ; in reference to how TransUnion has verified this erroneous public record. I inquired to know this information as the public record continues coming back as my public record. In addition to my several written request, I have spoken with various customer service representatives and 3 of the 5 informed me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse and once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. At that point, I advised the representative that I would like to cancel this dispute and they advised me that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact the court directly with my name and the case number. 
After seeking legal consultation, I was advised to contact the court directly to inquire on their protocol and procedures, for submitting public records to various credit bureaus. After I contacted the court, the clerk advised me that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. 
At the point, I contacted TransUnion once again and spoke with another representative ; this time she advised me the information is verified by a 'runner ' who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the 'runner ' give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. At this time, the representative was unable to answer my question ; as a result, I requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor advised me due to this being an ongoing re-investigation ; therefore no 'runner ' is involved. She advised me that they use a form which is sent r to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and exactly where the form it sent as the court clerk confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. Furthermore, I asked if she could provide me with a copy of this form. TransUnion refuses to give me any physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this bankruptcy is mine.

Second, they are constantly removing INACCURATE personal information, addresses, etc. but placing it back on the credit file without sending notification within the 5 days like they are supposed to.

"My husband had agreed to repay the loan on a monthly installment plan. This particular company has been debiting his checking monthly for the past twelve months in the amount of {$110.00}. We received a letter from the collection company indicating we were not making payments on the loan. I called to inquire as to the status of this account. I first spoke with a young man by the name of XXXX. He was not able to help me so he transferred the call to his manager, XXXX. XXXX explained to me that the letter was a mere formality to notify the customer that the contract needed to be re-negotiated, even though the letter never said anything about calling them to re-negotiate a contract with them. XXXX stated that they wanted more money. I agreed to pay an additional $ XXXX monthly from my separate bank account on a different day of the month. XXXX stated that we could do that and it would be easy enough to set up. To be clear, I repeated, my husband would continue to repay at {$110.00} on the XXXX of the month from his bank ( XXXX ) and I would pay an additional {$100.00} on the XXXX of the month from my banking institution, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX repeated this back to me, took my banking information and I thought we were good. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, MY XXXX checking account was debited {$110.00} plus {$30.00} overdraft fee by the collection company. 

My husband called the company and spoke to XXXX when I discovered the error two days later. She was confused as to what the problem was because she only saw information for the XXXX account, nothing for his XXXX account. She agreed to pull the voice recording and allow my husband and I to listen to the original conversation setting up this arrangement. The next day when I spoke with XXXX regarding the mistake, he stated that this is the arrangement that I made with him, that the money be taken out of my account on the XXXX. I tried to explain that the money was taken out of XXXX on the XXXX ; he argued with me and said that was not true. I said to him "" Im looking at my account and the money was taken out, plus {$30.00} overdraft fee. '' He told me I was wrong. Then he said, "" well that 's the way you set it up with me. '' I said, "" No, I did not set it up that way. '' I asked to listen to the voice recording of the original conversation with him. He would not let me listen. He said they do n't do that. He kept insisting that the mistake was mine and he could not do nothing about it. He said my husband authorized XXXX to erase all of our banking records the day before, so he could n't pull anything up to look for the error. He INSISTED that I obviously did not know what I was doing and he could do nothing to try and rectify this error. 

He never used obscene language, but his attitude was bad, and he became hostile after I asked him to reverse the transaction. The other employees we spoke to within the company were very nice and did as much as they were allow to do. The manager of this company lied. I set these payments up to clear them as quickly as we could. He originally said it was possible to do it the way I wanted but apparently he was wrong. If he made an error I could have accepted that, but he was very hostile and refused to help me in any way or offer to investigate and call us back. His behavior was completely unprofessional and I could not recommend this company to anyone.",Debt collection,0,0

Realizing that he could not pay the monthly payments for the used pick up truck, my husband called to return it on the second week.It was picked up after more than two weeks. 
As a wife of XXXX years, I asked about a signed contract for the transaction, but my husband had no copy to show me. Neither was there a copy of the return transaction. In short, I did not see a contract at all! 
I would describe this deal as done without following proper procedures. There was no careful screening as to the financial background whether my husband could afford to pay or not. Also, no proper interview was done to ascertain my husband health issue as to competence in making a car purchase without consulting me as a wife. If the agent was careful enough he would have seen that my husband could hardly talk, hardly walk, and even hard of hearing on his right ear. My husband is XXXX, and has XXXX. With medications he gets XXXX and does things he does not mean to do, like buying he truck he did not need.

"XXXX XXXX, XXXX I performed a periodic review of my credit report through a service that Transunion offers and discovered that a summary judgment had been filed against me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in the amount of {$18000.00} in XXXX XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX # : XXXX XXXX for an outstanding debt on an auto lease owed to BMW Financial Services. 

I had a 36 month lease with BMW Financial Services with a beginning balance of {$27000.00} that commenced in XXXX XXXX. Monthly payments were {$770.00}. My last payment on the vehicle was XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX it was repossessed. I spoke to XXXX XXXX at the time and was told they did not plan to pursue the remaining balance as the car had sold almost immediately and was well under the mileage requirement. This might be unusual, but I had no reason to believe anything else was the case as I 've heard nothing further from either XXXX or any third party collection agency until I saw the judgment appear in my credit report. 

I immediately retained counsel referred to me by the VA XXXX XXXX and my attorney discovered that notice had been posted on the door of an apartment I have not lived in since XXXX XXXX. It is n't even the last address of record with XXXX. 

The summary judgment was dismissed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Opposing counsel ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) for XXXX XXXX XXXX had until XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide some evidence of the debt. The deadline passed with no evidence given. My attorney XXXX XXXX spoke to XXXX and was told they no longer planned to pursue because of their lack of evidence and a nonsuit would be filed. 

On several occasions opposing counsel had not appeared for during scheduled court appearances and the judge had given a continuance. Because of this we went to court yesterday to request that the case be dismissed with prejudice due to the lack of evidence. The opposing counsel did appear and stated at this time that a nonsuit had been filed. 

I 've spent nearly {$2000.00} in attorney fees, not only has my credit been affected for the last year, but because I 'm a registered representative working for a broker/dealer, I 'm required to disclose the judgment to the agency XXXX which then has that information as public for anyone to access when they run XXXX 's broker check on me. To this day I have never ONCE seen a solitary piece of paper from XXXX XXXX XXXX notifying me of their intention to collect on a debt ... ..nor did they provide a single document when requested to do so in court. Not XXXX. 

Surely there is some recourse that consumers have when such frivolous lawsuits are filed with no substance whatsoever and with the intent to collect on a debt that they have no evidence exists? The ability to file a last minute "" nonsuit '' seems to have prevented them from having to admit this in front of a judge, but it has also left the door open for them to pursue the issue XXXX more time. At a minimum, they should be responsible for the attorney fees I 've incurred. I 'm surprised that this is even legal. 

I have any and all documentation supporting everything outlined above if requested. I 've never filed a complaint to any agency anywhere. But this group could have garnished my wages and caused horrific damage to my ability to support myself and my daughter while having nothing to prove any debt was owed at all. I find it suspicious that I was notified of the original court date with a notice on my door for an address they would have known was n't accurate if they did receive their information from BMW Financial.

"In XXXX of XXXX I was behind by a payment on seven private loans with Navient, so I called to make a payment and find out what options I had on dealing with the issue. 

XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a representative named XXXX who helped me apply for forbearance and request a rate reduction program. I made a payment of {$450.00} to bring my account current and specifically asked her if I needed to do anything to ensure it wouldn't affect my credit report ( as nothing had been submitted yet ). She recommended making an additional payment to ensure it doesn't go past due while I was waiting for approval of the rate reduction program. I made another payment on the same call for {$300.00}. As part of setting up the program, I also set up autopay to have {$450.00} paid on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to keep the account current while I was pending the program. Those payments both came out as well on the respective dates. 

XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that a delinquency was posted on my account ( per XXXX ) and I was confused because I was told by XXXX that this wouldn't happen and I hadn't lapsed in payments. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called Navient and spoke with a manager in collection named XXXX. I explained what happened and asked about the credit reporting and he said they were "" backed up and they falsely reported '' the delinquency. XXXX told me that "" the collection will be reversed '' and on "" XX/XX/XXXX theyll rescind the delinquency ''. He also informed me that I was approved for the rate reduction program and would be paying {$450.00} a month with 3 % interest rate on all of my loans for the next 6 months. 

XX/XX/XXXX My credit report still shows a delinquency so I called Navient again to follow up on the issue. I spoke with XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who read my account notes and said there is a note that they requested it changed and late fees should be removed. She transferred me to a manager named XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who said there was nothing he could do about reversing a delinquency. He said he would add notes to my account and request a review from an ombudsman who would review the calls I referenced and determine if my complaint was valid. He told me this person would reach out in 2-3 days at most and it's been a week and I haven't heard anything. 

XX/XX/XXXX I also submitted disputes with XXXX for the four loans that show as delinquent. I don't understand why it was only four loans since I have seven loans with Navient.

"We were leasing 2 XXXX vehicles and the maturity was XX/XX/18. 
Last XX/XX/XXXX we received letters from XXXX that close to the date of the maturity of our leases we had to contact them, and we did call them only to be told that was too early and that we could visit our dealership when we were going to be ready for the purchase. 
I need to mention that we were going to purchase both of the vehicles because of extra mileage. 
So on XX/XX/18 we drove both of our cars to the XXXX XXXX dealership on XXXX XXXX ( the XXXX. XXXX location ) as one of our cars was scheduled for an oil change at their serv. dept. We asked to see the sales manager so we can talk about the purchase of both cars, he asked us if we wanted to look into a new purchase and we told him that we -couldn't- because of the extra millage on the leased cars we had. He told that we could work out a better deal if we buy 2 new cars instead of those old ones. Of course again -our biggest concern was the extra millage and the fee that we were going to have to pay- but the sales manager told  us that it was not going to be that big of amount and that we could work a payment settlement with XXXX XXXX when they'll contact us. 
One of the leased cars had some manufactures issues that we were dealing with through out the last 2 year with the same dealership and the sales manager was aware, still he persuade us that, that was the best thing to do. To return the old defected car and the other one, and get 2 brand new ones on a good deal and work out a monthly payment deal on top of our purchase payments for the extra millage fees. 
Once again, we were asking how much more it would be and why the amount could be included in the new purchase, but after consulting with the Financial Manager we were told that Hyundai wont finance us due to our credit and they looked into other financial companies ( Needless to say that they never mention to us that doing something like that meant that we had to pay a {$400.00} fee per vehicle for disposition plus excess wear and use, plus taxes on everything and on top of all we never signed anything regarding inspection for the returned cars, they never gave us paperwork regarding the returned vehicles, nothing regarding the millage and the excess wear cause there was no inspection done while we were there ) A month later we received 2 letters ( one for each returned car ) for outstanding fees as they call them. They are asking for {$16000.00} for one car and {$5400.00} for the other, when the sales manager said with certainty that it was not more that {$18000.00} for both cars. Again, he or the financial manager, never said anything about extra fees. 
When we called the XXXX XXXX dept. and asked about these fees and to arrange a settlement to pay, we were informed that such thing is not possible! That we have until the XX/XX/2018 to pay in full the amount for both cars -or- they'll send it to collections agency. I did try to explain to Ms XXXX ( the person on the phone ) that its not possible for me to pay all this amount of money in such a sort period of time and that we were told otherwise from the people in XXXX XXXX dealership on the day of return of those vehicles plus that we never received any paperwork for an inspection done on those cars and the answer was that it was MY responsibility to know what to do and that the people in the dealership could have had forgotten to mention the details. That I should had call the Lease Maturity dept. to find out how exactly i had to return the cars before going to the dealership. I asked to make a monthly payment deal, even for 12 months and she said that is not possible either. that the payment can be extended to the fullest of 120days from return which is the date she gave me XX/XX/18. She also told me that i can pay by debit card over the phone or mail a check of any amount I want but if the total amount is not paid off till that day, then the rest is going to be send to collections agency and that will ruin my credit! 
As I mentioned before, we wanted to purchase both of the vehicles and that was the reason of our visit to the dealership ( besides the oil change ) that day, but we believe that the misleading and manipulating ways of those people drove us into this rabbit hole.

More recently, I made the decision to come off of my income driven repayment plan based upon two emails I received from Navient that said quote : "" On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, your Monthly Payment for your loans enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan is set to increase to {$160.00}. 

This is the maximum amount you 'll be required to pay each month while you 're in an IDR plan, but you may be able to lower your Monthly Payment if you qualify for a new XXXX partial financial hardship period. '' XXXX was certainly a payment that I was able to make, so I let my IDR expire only to see that my payment was indeed quite a great deal more than XXXX. Bad information from Navient. 

Furthermore, calling Navient to actually make my payments continues to be nothing short of farcical. First, I need to call either from XXXX which is unreliable, or from a landline in XXXX which is costly. Then, each time I speak to them, I have to go through the same song and dance about the phone number they have on file ... .I mean this most recent time must have been the XXXX or XXXX time I have been asked to verify if my phone number was still one from when I lived in XXXX XXXX which I have n't lived in for nearly a decade. 

What kind of nonsense is this? What is happening to the up to date information that I have repeatedly supplied them? Why is it that they can get away with such persistent incompetence, especially given the fact that this incompetence has more than once caused me financial stress and hardship? I also ca n't help but feel that Navient 's payment system discriminates against people who no longer live in the USA, making it nigh on impossible to simply make a payment.",Loans,0,0

"I obtained a student loan in XX/XX/XXXX as a teenager on my own in order to go to art school. I completed and graduated from art school in XX/XX/XXXX and was successful in my field early on, but the technology changed quickly and my skills were soon outdated.

I originally borrowed approximately {$20000.00} for a two year program, but not long after graduation, I was no longer employed in the field and my school did not honor its promise that they would continue to help with employment after graduation. 

I was employed, but struggled to continue to pay my student loans and my XX/XX/XXXX, I had defaulted and lost everything. I moved back home and was able to get back on track paying my loans and decided to go back to school at University XXXX XXXX XXXX. None of the credits I had earned at XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX were transferable to XXXX, so I had to start completely over on my XXXX degree, even re-taking the prerequisites. While I was a student at XXXX, my loans were on deferment, gathering interest for 6 years while I studied for my XXXX degree. I did not use student loans for my XXXX degree at XXXX. 

I graduated from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and had a baby in XX/XX/XXXX. Needless to say, that making my student loan payments was the least of my worries. I defaulted on the loans with Sallie Mae and was able to get back on track with my payments after my divorce in XX/XX/XXXX. But by that time, my loan balance had grown from my original {$20000.00} to almost {$80000.00}! 

I am paying my student loan now under the income based repayment plan, and I am a single parent, so it is based only on my income. But, I have not managed to make a dent in the loan after all these years, and I will be paying for this mistake until I am at least XXXX years old. I can not buy a home because Sallie Mae is still reporting on my credit report, even though they no longer service the loan. 

I requested my original loan documents from Navient from when I first signed back in XX/XX/XXXX, but Navient could not locate them. I have tried before to settle this matter and reduce the debt so that I could eventually pay it off, but my requests fell on deaf ears. I have been wronged and not given ample resources to pay this off. It seems incredibly unfair to try and repay over {$60000.00} in interest charges.

"To Whom It May Concern : When we took out the student loans, we dealt with  XXXX   XXXX . We had no issues ; all accounts were paid and up to date. We never experienced any issues. When the loans we taken over by Navient, all of a sudden, we were getting accounts that were being paid and being misapplied to other accounts. When we contacted  Navient, we attempted to set up direct withdrawals on a monthly basis, with all our accounts. It seemed to have worked for a month or two , then after that period of time, we realized, that they were no longer withdrawing the set amount agreed upon. We contacted them yet again, and were told that, that program was no longer in effect. We agreed upon a set amount of money, and that was perfectly fine, until the time ran out. I contacted them to set up that amount of money aga  in, and they refused. They told us, the only way to bring the accounts current was to put them in forbearance, which of course, accumulated more interest and more fees.
I took that amount of money and divided it up amongst the 2 accounts evenly, and now they have totally destroyed our credit.
So then we started all over again. We again spoke to a Navient representative, to set up a direct withdrawal program, which again worked for a few months and   the same thing happened ( the program was no longer in effect ). As our frustration mounted, we again realized, that any payments we made were again being misapplied to different accounts. We have received several bills with different account numbers, and different loan numbers. When we called Navient, the total amount of time wasted, constantly repeating our situation, it got more and more confusing and exasperating. We contacted Navient by phone several times, when we found someone that sounded sympathetic, that was willing to work with us, we could never reach the same person twice. On numerous occasions, we asked to speak to a supervisor in which case we were treated like garbage. They told us, we would have to give them a financial statement to see if we qualified for a different program. When they asked for a financial statement, we realized, they were trying to tell us, how much we could afford as opposed to the reality of our situation. We have tried to make payments online, but every month we get notices that we owe a complet  ely different amount than what we paid.
We are at the breaking point now, that dealing with Navient, has been a infuriating experience to say the least. We have tried to pay what we can every   month, but we feel like there no end in sight and there is nothing we have been able to do, to get the situation under control. We get constant phone calls that begin at  XXXX   XXXX  on Saturday and continue all day everyday,  7days  a week. We do not know where or what to do at this point, thats the reason we are writing this letter to see if we can get some relief for our situation so we can pay off these loans. As we are caught in this vicious circle, the interest on our loans keeps accumulating. We have tried to apply for other debt servicing companies to get away from Navient, but they have sufficiently ruined our credit to the point where we can not get approved anywhere.

"My grievance with both "" Sallie Mae '' and "" XXXX '' involves a procedure/practice of the company ( XXXX ) more so than a one-time occurrence. 

I frequently make additional payments towards my Sallie Mae/XXXX student loans and have been doing so for over 5 years now. When making my additional payments, I focus on one specific loan, ( referred to herein as my "" targeted loan '' ), at a time so that the targeted loan can be paid off and thereby eliminate the mandatory monthly payment from my expenses. 

The issue with SallieMae/XXXX is that when I 've attempted to make additional payments on one targeted loan, if the payment for your "" Loan Group '' is due, both the Sallie Mae and XXXX websites will require you to make the payment on your "" Loan Group '' due before allowing you to pay an additional payment on a specific/targeted loan. 

The problem I have with this is that the "" Loan Group '' becomes due usually around 30 days prior to the date the payment is actually due by, thereby disenabling myself ( and others ) from being able to pay extra towards a targeted loan unless I pay my "" Loan Group '' due amount early. 

So for example, say I want to pay an additional {$50.00} towards my Loan 1-10 on XX/XX/2017, but my Loan Group payment is showing as due by XX/XX/2017 and requires that I pay {$250.00}. I am unable to pay the additional {$50.00} towards my targeted loan until I 've paid the Loan Group, even though the loan group is n't actually due for 24 days! 

Being paid bi-weekly, if I wanted to make this extra payment towards my targeted loan and thus by doing so be forced pay my "" Loan Group '' at times over 20 days in advance of the due date, it would have detrimental impact on my budget. If Sallie Mae/XXXX would have allowed me to make the additional {$50.00} payment at the time I so chose to ( without the required Loan Group payment being a mandated prerequisite ), I could have saved money in the amount of interest I am being charged on a per diem basis on my targeted loan and would have been able to pay my targeted loan off much earlier the burden to pay my Loan Group early would not have prevented my additional payments on my targeted loan. 

I think this practice is very unfair to the consumer and if it had been disallowed years ago could have saved me a great deal of stress from the burden of financial hardship I was faced with in repaying my student loans, and I 'm sure many others like me. 

I 've noticed this practice with Sallie Mae/XXXX on its servicing of Private/High interest rate loans, Department of Education Loans, and Federal Loans ( subsidized and non-subsidized ). 

Having begun my post-college student loan repayment with over 12 different student loans, the vast majority of which serviced by Sallie Mae and subsequently XXXX, I have become familiarized with this occurrence that I feel is greatly unfair to borrowers, although the impact on an individual person may not be immediately devastating, but the practice is unfairly benefiting the lender at the expense of the borrower. I feel very strongly that the practice should be eliminated and those impacted shown some form of compensation for the unnecessary prolonging of their indebtedness to Sallie Mae/XXXX.",Loans,0,0

"Hello. My story is sad but true. It's like millions of others, I'm sure but still no less sad because it is my own issue. My own life 's issue. I am an XXXX and I pursued my dream of being an XXXX  when I went to college, XXXX University, and then was accepted into the prestigious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   Graduate XXXX Program at XXXX. It was a great program and one where students were afforded many professional opportunities that many XXXX who hadn't gone to school didn't receive. I had received {$40000.00} in scholarship money to attend XXXX and I borrowed another {$40000.00} to pay for living expenses and the tuition difference for the next three years. In addition to the {$10000.00} I had taken out for XXXX study from XXXX, in XXXX I was {$50000.00} in debt with principal at 8.25 % interest. I also had taken out a Perkins loan for {$2500.00} that I had paid off within five years of graduation. After graduating XXXX, I worked in theater steadily for the next three years. My salary at $ XXXX week wasn't tremendous but I was a working XXXX! After the 6 month grace period however my loan servicer, then Sallie Mae, told me I would owe $ XXXXmonth on top of my rent and bills but if that would be a problem they said I could defer payments for upto 2 years or I could "" forbear '' payments, essentially stopping payments, basically so I would not have to worry about payments. As the years went by I had to keep forbearing or deferring payments. My loans were bought and sold as so much trash by XXXX, Navient, Sallie Mae, and finally Navient again. I'm sure there were other servicers who bought the loans but I can not rememember all of them. They seemed to change each or every other year. I would constantly ask for statements at the end of the deferrment period to see how much interest was 'capitalized ' to the principal but most of the servicer 's employees were from XXXX and either they didn't understand what I meant when I said, "" Please send me a paper statement when the loan is about to start repayment so I can see how much interest has accrued '' or they just disregarded it as unimportant. It was probably the latter as I'm sure many of us asked for statements but because the loans had switched hands so much the servicers only needed to get permission to defer or forbear payments and then forget about the rest of the service call. Their bank was getting what they wanted. People whose initial principal wasn't enormous, although owing {$50000.00} is pretty enormous would see the balance balloon to enormous sums because we weren't being kept aware of how the principal kept growing. The agents were always so understanding and supportive on the call about giving out more deferment or forbearance time because we needed help. Outside of paying my rent on a New York rent stabilized apt , borrowing for school has been my only borrowing experience. Fast forward to some years later when I was in a long running play, or on tour and I would have a modest steady income and I would try and knock off some of the principal but the interest alone now was over {$1000.00} so I asked about repayment options. I was put on income sensitive plans or income contingent plans and had some years where I was able to pay some of the loan 's interest back but unfortunately those plan were not the 'right income sensitive ' plan to qualify for payments towards loan forgiveness. Once again, misleading information that is only found out years later when the issue is too big now to be ignored and I'm trying to figure out a way out of this mess. As it stands right now I have about two, maybe three years towards loan forgiveness. My principal is now {$90000.00}! I am in the "" REPAYE '' plan which I need to reapply for each year. This year my payment was $ XXXX month based on my expenses and income from the previous year however I'm still not paying anything toward taking down the principal so the interest gets added to the amount and the amount keeps growing. I'm XXXX years old. Still an XXXX. I make around XXXX/year between XXXX work, side gigs like XXXX, and unemployment but it changes every year and I don't receive a weekly check like a banker. I get paid for something then I have to stretch that money out to pay health insurance/medical costs, union dues, not to mention rent, bills and the occasional piece of pizza. I live in XXXX which is very expensive. I have under {$10000.00} in retirement savings and with streaming media taking away a lot of union work XXXX in commercials things have been getting worse and worse in the last 5 years. Producers and ad agencies don't care about XXXX. There aren't government regs to restrict this from happening and our union is virtually a non factor in protecting our livliehood. I yearn for a night when I can sleep through without waking up in an anxious sweat. I have this {$90000.00} debt hanging over my head with no real possibility to pay it off in my lifetime. I'm wondering how I could have let this happen but more importantly, I'm wondering why there aren't any regulations in place to protect borrowers from this sort of practice. The 'ever polite and supportive bank who says, "" You can have another forbearance, no problem ''. Additionally, had I been told about the "" proper '' repayment plan to be on years ago, I would have a few more years invested in the loan forgiveness program and I would not be staring down this dark tunnel. Had their practices been less predatory in a 'folksy kind of way ' but instead 'transparent in an honest way ', I would not be 25 years out of graduate school looking at double the amount I borrowed with not very good prospects to pay it all off.",Loans,0,0

"Most of my student loans have been serviced by Nelnet since starting college.

I was forced to leave school and while doing that I was advised by the school 's financial advisor that after XXXX months my student loans would start to become due. Though I was battling homelessness, I still managed to call in and apply online for debt consolidation so that I can get in control of my finances. I chose to consolidate with Nelnet because they were already servicing most of my loans. I completed my consolidation application before the first payments were to become due on all of my loans. I subsequently called into the servicer and advised them that I was in the process of consolidating and was not working. The representative on the phone said that a consolidation application takes time to be approved but in the mean time she will make note of my lack of my income so that payment will not be due while the accounts are in the process of getting consolidating. I thought all was fine after doing my due diligence with Nelnet and keeping them in the know.

I am completely outraged by Nelnet 's inconsistencies and false reassurances. A total of XXXX ( XXXX ) account became immediately marked late by 90 days.

I would also like to know if terms of the loan have been changed at any point, as I do not have recollection of receiving any information. 

I have attempted to obtain information regarding my loan on the Navient website to determine what my payment options are. When options for repayment is selected, I receive an error message stating I need to call Navient directly. Navient will not answer email regarding my questions. When I call them, the last call being XX/XX/XXXX, the operator consistently changes the terms and amounts for payments. He ( agent XXXX ) initially wanted to add 100 payments to the back end of my loan in order to negotiate any reduction in monthly payment. He did not provide any explanation as to the addition of 100 payments and states he can not not provide any detail or reasoning on that. He then offered another program for 9 months at a reduced interest rate ; however, the terms are very vague, and he refuses to allow any review of paperwork on terms unless I provide a credit card so that automatic payments can be deducted on a monthly basis. 

Each time Navient is called, vague and differing terms and amounts for monthly payments are provided, with no explanations given. When I ask for detail, the operator states they can not provide any unless I give them a credit card and opt into their program. When I provide any hesitation, the operator will give another amount as monthly payment.

Interestingly, the CFPB is suing Navient because the company : & gt ; created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information ; & gt ; processed payments incorrectly ; & gt ; failed to act when borrowers complained ; & gt ; illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower payments, which caused them to overpay for their student loans ; & gt ; deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan ; and & gt ; harmed the credit of XXXX borrowers, including XXXX veterans I 've also read up on your CEO, and he fits the profile of the usual corporate crook, finding a way to maximize yield for investors through a business model that financially exploits middle class people who do not have expandable monthly budgets. I am one of those people. 

My first call tomorrow will be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to see what they can do for me. 

In the meantime, what solutions do you have to offer?

"I have made my student loan payments on time for the full amount since I got out of school. I have several different student loans based on the years in school and I have XXXX loans being serviced by AES ( American Education Services ). The loan issue that I am complaining about is being serviced by AES. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I went on their website and submitted an ACH payment change request. The notice that was on the change request says the following "" Your existing Direct Debit agreement will be stopped. By submitting a new agreement, we will not debit your monthly installment until the new agreement takes effect. Processing the new agreement may take up to 3 days during which time you will not receive the interest rate reduction ( if applicable ). you may be required to submit payments manually until you receive notification from us stating when the direct debit service will resume. '' After reading that statement I set up a manual payment to ensure my payment would not be late. The ACH payment change request I submitted was for an increase of {$490.00}. Despite the fact that the notice said my existing direct debit agreement will be stopped AES took out my normal direct debit amount and the manual payment ( in essence 2 payments instead of 1 ). After a month I received no written or verbal communication from AES so I called their toll free number and inquired as to why it was taking to long to make a simple payment change and I was informed that "" it had to go to a payment change committee to decide if they will allow me to have my payment increased. '' I was baffled that they would possibly not allow me to pay additional money so that my loan can be paid off sooner. They told me to wait longer and I would receive a letter within a couple weeks. After another month ( now 2 months after the initial request was submitted ) I still had not received any communication from AES so I called their toll free number again and spoke to employee ID XXXX who besides being quite rude said they could n't determine what the problem is with my request. He guessed that I should submit a manual form and mail it in. After I explained I already submitted a form 2 months ago online he said that I should just mail a form in ( despite not providing a form ) and said that the website was broken. I did not want to mail in a form for security reasons as the electronic form is more secure which is why I originally utilized their online account. I asked what he could do to fix the situation and all he said it submit more paperwork and see what happens. I asked to speak to the office of the president and a representative ( employee ID XXXX ) took my information on what I wanted my new payment to be and said he would send it to the ACH department for them to review. The representative said they would try to get back to me within 7-10 days. This issue is still not resolved and it is making me feel as though they wo n't increase my payment which will allow me to pay my loan off sooner since that will decrease the amount of interest they receive on the loan. I wish I could request a loan transfer so none of my loans are serviced by AES!",Loans,0,0
"This is a response after seeing an article in the XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I graduated XXXX in XXXX, at that point I realized in 6 months I would have to start paying back almost {$1000.00} a month to Navient ( XXXX XXXX at the time ). I decided to take this seriously, my father is a cosigner on the loan and I did not want his credit to be affected. Also I wanted to payback my loan and be out of debt. However living in XXXX would be too expensive. I decided to move back home to upstate XXXX with my parents, away from the place I was most likely to receive jobs in my field. The other problem I would face is that working in this industry most of the time potential employers would expect someone new in the field to work for free for the first year or so. This was n't an option for me, I knew I had to work hard and fast. A month after moving back home I got my first job on a small movie, no pay but the experience and people were amazing. From working hard and making the right impressions, one of the producers hired me on another small film, again no pay however that job lead to another one that was paid. {$250.00} a week for a month which is n't too bad and I would have had that {$1000.00} however I also had a car payment and insurance. Now I had one month left to start paying back my loan and I had pretty much a few hundred dollars to my name. I had gotten another paid film job after the first one but it still was n't enough. I ended up calling XXXX to discuss any options I had, the first one being a forbearance. I was told pay {$50.00} and delay your loan payment 3 months ( with added interest of course ) I had no other options so what was I going to do? Three months later I 'm struggling to find a job in my field, using the money I had for gas or train tickets to interviews, I was then again forced to forbearance my loan. This happened a few times, XXXX eventually offered me a reduction in my loan payments to about half of the initial payment ( about {$500.00} ) which basically I was paying the interest and not touching the principle. I was forced to get a part time job at a local retailer, eventually getting XXXX to XXXX jobs at certain points. Flash forward to XX/XX/XXXX, my reduction plan ended and again was expected to pay close to {$1000.00} month on top of my rent, car payment, insurance, and other bills. I called up Navient to discuss options, as I was willing to pay on my loan however I could not afford the {$1000.00} a month. I then took a financial statement over the phone to where the woman on the phone offered me a {$600.00} a month payment option which I was willing to take but only if I could get my dad to call in and do a financial statement so they could have it on record. I said sure whatever it takes ... after my father calls gives his financial statement they tell him he makes too much and tries to collet the {$1000.00} payment from him. My father WAS doing well the year before however at the beginning of XXXX he got hit with financial issues which he had to disclose with me because of the loan situation, by the way not something I wanted to know. I called Naivient back to let them know I 'm the only person paying for this, why was I lied to about the {$600.00} payment then ended up in a yelling match over the phone where the only thing coming out the operators voice was "" your father makes enough money! '' and I do n't yell. A week later I decide to pick up a call from Navient, told the operator everything that happened and even told him I 'm not destroying the relationship with my father over a student loan/my education. The operator agreed and then offered me 3 options ... and we figured out a 4th option. Where were these options before? Why was I XXXX for a month? and how come I 've paid back {$30000.00} plus in interest and never touch the principle?

"On XX/XX/2018 we paid our RV loan in full with an overage. The payment made by a third party buyer was in excess of the payoff amount, and paid in the form of a cashier 's check. We deposited the check to Huntington Bank that same day and were told that we could expect a refund check in 7 business days. The check did not arrive, but we received a payoff letter stating our account was paid in full and closed. We called to inquire about the title and check, and were told they couldn't do anything until it was 20 days deficient. We waited the 20 days and asked for the check and title. We were told they could reissue the check and title, but the fastest way to obtain the title would be to take the letter to the XXXX. The letter had the wrong address, so the XXXX won't release the title to me. They asked me to go back to my bank to get this corrected. I called Huntington again on XX/XX/18 and explained the letter had the incorrect address, I'm not able to get the title for my vehicle. They admitted that they put the incorrect information in their system and the check, title, and letter all had the incorrect address. They reissued the check and title at this time. Today is XX/XX/18 - 5 additional business days and I still don't have a check or title. I live within a 10 mile radius of Huntington Bank 's corporate office. I have called and pleaded with this company to do the right thing and provide me with money that was never theirs. They refused. I asked to have them do an Electronic Funds Transfer from their bank to mine. They refused. I asked for them to make the funds available for withdrawal at a local branch. They refused. They have my title and my money - they are taking no steps ( other than standard "" It's in the mail, what else do you want from us '' ) to resolve this issue. I expect that if a company finds their process failed, they would do what they can in order to do right by the customer. I feel that not only is this not in Huntington 's process, the representatives they employ are beholden to a corporate motto and can not think/deviate from this process. If this situation were reversed, I would be assessed a daily fee until the funds were deposited to them. The irony of a bank being late paying a consumer and using the phrase "" the check is in the mail '' should not be lost with anyone. I hope that this example enables a quality review of their practice and processes when something doesn't go correctly. I hope that this complaint is the only one of it's type that Huntington has to deal with. I hope that Huntington truly values customers as their vision says "" At Huntington, we see it as our responsibility to look out for people. Theres a common bond that connects us all as humans, and together, we can make this world better.

"I signed a retail installment contract on XXXX in the state of Washington, the APR is 20.49 %, the amount financed is {$17000.00} and the finance charge ( or cost of the whole credit ) is {$13000.00}. I put down a {$600.00} down payment, and traded in my car which counted for {$1400.00}. The total amount was {$32000.00} which is nearly double the amount of money financed to me. 

When I asked GM Financial, the lienholder, when my account was opened, I was advised ( via chat ) : "" XXXX at XXXX, XXXX XXXX : Hello XXXX, I show that the loan was opened XX/XX/XXXX. '' I contend the installment sale contracts I signed, that was immediately assigned to the bank, that the transaction is really a loan from the bank and documenting it as an installment sale is just a sham to avoid the usury limit, which in the state of WA where the sale took place is 12 % per year. If this kind of business practice is lawful, why would n't every dealer have a buyer sign a retail installment contract in conjunction with an auto loan from a lender in order to profit from unreasonable interest rates? If the agreement between the lender and the dealer is what makes it a "" retail installment contract '' as opposed to a loan which is directly between the lender and buyer, then why am I paying GM financial, and not XXXX XXXX? 

I do feel that this is usury. In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX, the buyer bought a new vehicle from a dealer with a down payment and an agreement to pay the balance over several installments. According to the conditional sales contract, the buyer would make payments directly to a bank that was financing the sale. The contract was furnished to the dealer by the bank, which had an agreement with the dealer to buy all such contracts, if acceptable. On the next business day after the transaction was executed, the contract was assigned to the bank. When the buyer eventually refused to make payments, the bank sued. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court 's entry of judgment for the bank, holding that the transaction was, in substance, a direct loan from the bank to the buyer. Noting that courts look through the form of a transaction and consider its substance in usury cases, XXXX held that this transaction was actually a cash sale, with a conditional sale used as a security device to protect the bank. Because the interest on the loan to the buyer exceeded 12 percent per annum, the contract was usurious.

Hiding behind a request by me not to receive automated collection calls is absurd. You officially, on the record, have my permission to call me to discuss this matter. 
2. Beginning in XXXX XXXX, by my frequent and regular communications with Discover I have expressed nothing by an interest in working out these obligations so that I can better pay them on a regular basis while also begin repaying my federally secured student loans. Asking for a principal reduction was only one request. If you were to spend some time listening to previous calls and reading account notes, had your team members properly documented the account, you would also hear my many requests to restructure the loans to lower the monthly payment. That can be done by graduating payments, amortizing over a longer period of time, forbearing one loan while the other is being repaid, reducing the interest rate, and on and on. The number of possible work out solutions is quite expansive. Instead, your company with their consistent and robotic responses have said there is nothing we can do.

I was also told, on numerous occasions now, that the loans would be turned over to the insurer after the loans have charged off at the expiration of 150 days past due. 
Since XXXX, I have been following that edict, alternating payments of approximately {$230.00} per loan around the XXXX and the XXXX of each month. The significance to those dates is that when I called in XXXX, I was told by the representative that Loan XXXX was at that time 141 days past due and that it would hit 150 days past due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On the same call, I was told that loan XXXX was 110 days past due and that it would hit the 150 days past due mark on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have not missed a payment since making the first payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Surprisingly, when I called this week on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to make a payment ( the first business day after XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), I was told both loans were 139 days past due and that they would hit the 150 day mark on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This is highly questionable given my payment history since XXXX and at the least, unfair and deceptive treatment given prior conversations with your company 's representatives. 
4. What has become even more alarming now, is that in your response to my CFPB inquiry and complaint is your position that you "" will be [ filling ] a claim with XXXX soon '' and that my only recourse at this stage is to bring the accounts current. Not only is this statement abusive in that it now threatens something that is contrary to what I have consistently been told since XXXX, it is unfair and deceptive. This bait and switch approach to collections is the very reason the CFPB exists, to help level the field and open communications between company and consumers. If I could afford to bring my accounts current on the schedule you now prescribe, I would not be talking to you, your collection representatives, or the CFPB.

"This is my second complaint against my loan service, being made one week after I filed the last. 

I have been harassed with phone calls for over a month, being prompted with inaccurate billing information. Today, the representative who contacted me uncovered even more issues with how this has been handled. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made what I believe was my final payment, only to be later called asking for {$110.00} dollars, and upon investigation the account shows only a {$4.00} balance. However that is from a late fee processed before requesting a final payoff amount. Every call since has requested the {$110.00} still despite being inaccurate. 

Today the service representative shocked by my situation, found that the late fee they have stated I owe was itself improperly processed and in fact I have overpaid my account and should have been issued a refund of {$0.00}. 

So I have received many calls, prompting me to pay {$110.00} when my balance was only {$4.00}, which I was told would be addressed. Only to find out from the 13th person I have spoken to about this, that not only was the {$4.00} mistaken, that it was improperly processed on my account and that I have in fact overpaid. Worst of all, none of the other reviews I have requested where ever actually targeted towards disputing that fee. 

This has been grossly mishandled, to the point that the rep I spoke with today agreed this all has been "" highly inappropriate '', and has only now after a dozen calls actually assisted me in filing to have it properly disputed. Apparently every other representatives assuring remarks ( save for one supervisors condescension ) have been hollow as none of them actually investigated my account to uncover the extent that it was mismanaged.",Loans,0,0

"On XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX XXXX I received a call on my cell phone from someone identifying themselves as Investigator XXXX. This person immediately started to scream at me regarding a Nissan Versa that is under my father 's name and that I am consigned on. XXXX did not explain the situation, she just began to scream that they were going to take my car and there was an alert out and I would not be allowed to take anything out of it. When I asked what was going on she just kept screaming "" ask you dad '' and refused to give me more information. 

My father has been making payments on this car since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never been contacted regarding a missed payment. I did not have access to this account prior to Friday XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX would not let me speak or give me answers. I know my rights, and I know that I have a right to be told what the problem is and I also have a right to try to fix it, which I did, immediately. Just like I would have made a payment if someone had contacted me XX/XX/XXXX when this problem began. I have a right to know if something is wrong. I have a right to not be screamed at and treated basically like I am a criminal. 

I understand this is my father 's fault. Lately he has proven himself untrustworthy and a liar, but I swear I did not know there was a problem. I rely on this vehicle to get to work, to take my daughter who is mentally ill to her appointments, and to take her to get her medications. I was terrified this weekend, even though I fixed the problem on Friday when someone in the Finance department finally listened to me and helped. I hid in my house, afraid that my daughter would be around for some repo man to violate my rights as a consumer. Every time I heard a car that sounded like a tow truck I cried. I hid. I am a citizen who has never been in trouble and this weekend I felt like someone was coming to arrest me. That is unacceptable. Just like my father not paying and not letting me know and giving you all the run around is unacceptable. 

Going forward I will be making the payments myself and I am taking the proper steps to remove him from this contract. I have not seen him and I have not talked to him prior to Friday when I called and asked what the problem was, and he continued to lie to me which tells me he has been lying to you all about the payments. I know you all probably hear this all the time, but I was not made aware of the situation, by my father or by Nissan. I would think that a call or a message to my cell would be the appropriate steps before having some "" investigator '' call me screaming about the car. If I would have known XX/XX/XXXX that there was a problem I would have paid, but I was not given that right. 

I have exercised my right to cure the default, and I now want a guaranteed that the system has been updated and that I do not have to be afraid that when I go somewhere my car will not be gone when I come out. I want to know why your employee is allowed to speak to me in the manner that was used. I want to know what is being done about the failure to notify me, the other person on the contract, that there was a problem. I want to know what the consequence is for Investigator XXXX not informing me what the problem is and letting me know my options. I do understand that this is a grave mistake made by my father, and I should have checked on it, but I did not have a reason to think anything was wrong since he has been paying for three years and most importantly was not made aware of a problem. I understand the gravity of the situation but feel that it could have been explained to me before I was screamed at. I have a right to know the details.

"Hello, I believe that FedLoan Servicing has acted inappropriately by forcing a forbearance on me when I did not ask for one, while they were re-calculating my IDR/IBR payment. Additionally, the forbearance was only for a month ( I seems ), and to add such a large amount of capitalized interest to my principal, all because of a one month forced forbearance, is cruel and excessive. 
The forced forbearance, capitalized approx. $ XXXX and applied it to my principal. I understand this is part of the rules of forbearance, but I did not ask for this forbearance, and even if I accidentally and passively allowed a forbearance because their verbage made it seem required during my re-calculation process, then that in itself was unnecessary and unfair. 
Additionally, the forbearance was only for a month, while they re-calculated and billed me for my new monthly payment. Why should I suffer with a $ XXXX growth of my principal, simply to ask for a re-calculation? 

I was ready and willing to pay my monthly payment during the month of my re-calculation, but there was no set dollar amount to pay, and I was sent EIGHT various and confusing letters solely during the month of XXXX, while I was waiting to find out what the re-calculated payment would be. I had no idea what to pay or when it was due because it kept changing all in the course of one month. 
Come XXXX, I see in my FedLoan online account, that my principal has grown by $ XXXX capitalization. 
What kind of practice is this? FedLoan has failed to process my request appropriately, they are perhaps guilty of purposefully confusing me with letters that state different information, they are guilty of using their forbearance rules to force my principal debt to increase, and they lacked in allowing me a say in the matter. 

I can afford my monthly IDR/IBR payment, but I can not allow them to bully me into growing my principal debt like this. How is this fair? How many other people are they doing this too? Why should such a drastic action be taken when all I asked was for a re-calculation? It is like I was penalized because I could not afford the standard monthly payment, so they said, "" ok, we 'll make a way to get that money by just forcing you into a forbearance and we 'll capitalize on some of your interest ''. 

What can be done about this? 
Why must I suffer financially and have to have loans through a shady servicer? 
Who can help me? Who can help Us Americans who are trying the best we can to repay our student loans? 

Please investigate. The best solution I would like to see from this, is for FedLoans to remove the capitalized interest that they just added to my account, it is an undue and unnecessary burden, inappropriately applied.

I called to explain this as I am in the ibr program and have been for years and also use direct debit for years.

XX/XX/XXXX : I sell XXXX bitcoin from my Coinbase account, which should result in a deposit of {$49000.00} into my XXXX account. No money arrives. 
( Screenshot XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ) .-.-.-. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Coinbase notifies me by email that "" this transaction [ ... ] was canceled by your bank '', and restores the XXXX to my Coinbase account. I visit my bank, where energetic inquiries can not find any evidence that a deposit was attempted. Alarmingly, the email is phrased in a way that suggests that Coinbase thought I was purchasing, not selling, the XXXX bitcoin. 
.-.-.-. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I email Coinbase to point out, emphatically, the possibility that they had mixed up buying and selling. 
Case # XXXX. 
( Screenshot XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ) .-.-.-. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I start moving bitcoin from Coinbase to a different bitcoin exchange, XXXX. My first tentative transfer is at XXXX PST. When I attempt to transfer the rest of my bitcoin, at XXXX PST, I notice that about 3 bitcoin are missing, and that a transaction has been recorded for the sale of XXXX bitcoin and the deposit of {$49000.00} to my XXXX account. This is the deposit that was never made.

"I am a XXXX customer and attempted to send money to a friend on XX/XX/XXXX using XXXX through XXXX on XXXX. The original transaction was canceled because I had never used online banking before. They asked me to come into a branch to verify the transaction, which I did. The XXXX banker ( XXXX ) at the XXXX, CA who helped me was great and we called the XXXX for XXXX through XXXX representative to verify that it was a valid transaction.

Unfortunately, the phone representative went ahead with the original transaction, even though I said the recipient 's phone number was flipped although the name is correct. The recipient is my friend, and the amount was for {$910.00}. The phone representative was hard to understand and both XXXX and I could not understand when he said things such as his name. He assured us that the transaction would be completed with the updated and correct phone number.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with XXXX because my friend had not received the funds and the account summary showed it went to the wrong number. My friend 's phone number ends with XXXX but the funds were deposited to a number ending in -XXXX. The person received a text with my name and my friend 's name and knowingly took the money even though it was obvious that the money was not meant for them.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX closed the claim saying that there 's nothing they can do. They said my only recourse is to contact XXXX. XXXX XXXX that because I used XXXX and not their mobile app, they could not help me. Both companies are pointing fingers while someone has taken {$910.00} from me and as a student living off financial aid, this is a significant amount of money for me.

I called the person who fraudulently deposited the money and left a message and sent a text saying I need them to contact me before XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX so we can resolve this issue and they can transfer the funds back to me. I also went to Bank of America in XXXX XXXX, where I spoke with XXXX XXXX  and XXXX, the bank manager. This visit occurred at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I told XXXX that one of their customers fraudulently took the funds that were obviously meant for someone else and XXXX was extremely condescending saying that there 's nothing I can do. I said that I could file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a police report naming Bank of America for being complicit in the fraudulent transaction and she said I can file all the reports that I want but I wo n't get my money back because I agreed to the terms and conditions of XXXX.

I followed up with visit with a trip to the same XXXX XXXX  location, where I spoke with XXXX, a banker who was extremely kind and said that XXXX at Bank of America is wrong, as it does n't matter what the terms and conditions are since she became aware of the fraudulent transaction when I told her and she did nothing about it. This makes me concerned that there are many victims of fraud through XXXX and banking institutions are not doing anything about it while knowing about the fraud, yet still advertising the service through their websites and advertisements.

XXXX said that they 'll investigate further and their banker XXXX said that he will call me back but he does n't know what the chances are that I 'll get my money back or that it will go to the correct recipient, my friend. I am also frustrated that XXXX at Bank of America in XXXX XXXX, CA is aware of the fraud and yet did not seem concerned and refused to contact their customer about this situation. She kept saying that there 's no way they can help.

Thank you so much for your help. I hope to get this resolved as soon as possible and appreciate your aid.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,0

"On the morning of XXXX XXXX, 2015, I woke up to several messages on my phone indicating that money had been transferred using my Google Wallet account. Assuming that my account had been hacked, I logged into my account from my computer, changed my password and began investigating. I found that XXXX {$300.00} transfers had been made to email addresses I was unfamiliar with. There were also a number of failed transfers for {$200.00} and {$300.00}. I am unaware of the reason some transactions went through at this time and others did not. In addition, {$500.00} had been loaded onto my Google Wallet account from my checking account ( with a {$14.00} transaction fee attached ), but was still there. Presumably, I logged in and changed the password before the hackers had the opportunity to do what they had intended with this money. 
At this point, I called Google 's customer support number to try to resolve the issue. The customer service agent I spoke with advised me that they would need to contact their resolutions department so that they could evaluate the charges. After waiting on hold, she came back and informed me that because the charges originated from my email address, they did not consider it to be an instance of hijacking, and as a result would not reverse any of the transactions. At this point, I pointed out that their own security page showed someone logging in from roughly XXXX XXXX miles from my location at the time the transactions took place, and that this seemed to be the very definition of hijacking. I was asked to hold again while she contacted the resolutions team to bring this to their attention. After another wait on hold I was told that their decision held, and that Google would not reverse any of the charges. 
At this point, the customer service agent gave me what, in hindsight, has been some of the worst advice I have ever received. She advised that since Google could not take care of the charges, that I should at least transfer the {$500.00} remaining in my Google Wallet account back to my checking account. I would be out the transaction fee, but at least I would have recovered the {$500.00}. I followed her advice and transferred the money. 
After speaking with one of the personal bankers at my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I filed a Card Transaction Dispute for the XXXX {$300.00} transfers. Since I had already transferred the {$500.00} I did not dispute this charge. I remained out the {$14.00} for the transaction fee, but decided I could handle that if the rest of the money were returned. I also filed a complaint with the California XXXX in the hopes that this would elicit a response from Google. In response to one, or both of these, Google reversed the XXXX {$300.00} charges. In addition, they did something with the {$500.00} charge, although it was not processed as a chargeback. On my Google Wallet Summary, where the other charges show up as "" Returned, '' this charge shows up as "" Failed. '' It cancelled the transaction in Google Wallet, but did not transfer me any money, presumably because I had already transferred the money back to my account. The end result is that while they did not give me {$500.00}, my Google Wallet account shows up as - {$500.00}. 
In my latest ( and last ) round of trying to deal directly with Google 's customer support, I was told that Google had initiated a chargeback with a reference number that I can provide, and that I could verify that the chargeback had gone through by contacting the card issuing bank. I have done so, and neither they, nor I, can find a chargeback in the amount of {$510.00} going onto my account. The closest we can find is the initial {$500.00} transfer that I have described above.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,0

On XX/XX/XXXX I was in transition in XXXX  ( XXXX ) airport and had an emergency happen, so I tried to look at my account at Coinbase to see how much money I could withdraw from it once I'm back on US soil. Understandably I was not able to log into the account because I was on sanctioned by the US politicians land. On XX/XX/XXXX I came back to the US and wanted to sell my assets from the Coinbase, however my account was locked. I called Coinbase about the problem and they told me to send an email to their support to unlock my account. I sent an email right away telling them to unlock my account. Im writing this email on XX/XX/XXXX and still response from Coinbase support. I call them every day for the past two weeks and their response that I need to send an email. The assets in my account have decreased by 70 % due to this fraudulent business.

First, my account shouldn't have been locked based on the information provided from Coinbase.

Second, I did not receive any response about my concern.

Third, the assets that I needed to sell onXX/XX/XXXX have decreased by 70 % which is a great financial burden on me and my family.

Fourth, there is no one at Coinbase wants to help me, I'm just stuck.

please investigate this fraudulent business and turn it in to the authorities so that there aren't others who get scammed by it.

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX. 
Wells Fargo I responded : I have no idea what you are referring to. I did not state I was traveling in XXXX. None of what you referred to was in the email I sent you. 
I received a wire transfer from the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in Yen. There was no ATM involved. There was no travel to XXXX. There was no purchase made. I was told by my branch manager in XXXX XXXXXXXX there would only be a {$15.00} wire transfer fee to receive money from the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
No other fees were mentioned. 

They responded by giving me a case # XXXX and saying they would look into it. And they would get back to me in 10 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX Called Foreign Currency Department XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX in XXXX XXXX. 
I spoke with XXXX XXXX about the rate of exchange. 
We spoke for over 30 minutes about how Wells Fargo deals with converting yen to dollars.

He told me various scenarios of how the bank puts the yen I received with other orders of yen to amass large amounts and then converts them.

I spent over 30 minutes asking XXXX XXXX what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to when deciding when during a day of, ( his words ), "" wildly fluctuating exchange rates, '' which they would use. Obviously, for me they used the largest Yen to dollar rate and I lost {$16000.00}. 
I questioned him to relate to me what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to about when and at what rate my yen gets converted. 
He told me that the amount of yen I received was small. I said I disagreed. 
XXXX XXXX said my amount transferred wasnt high enough to warrant a better rate. 
He said that day XX/XX/XXXX the rate fluctuated wildly from XXXX Yen per dollar to XXXX Yen per dollar. I obviously got the high Yen to Dollar rate to benefit Wells Fargo. 
He began to tell me when the amount in question was between {$100000.00} - {$500000.00}, that wasnt enough to warrant a better rate. 
I told him he was incorrect. He tried to repeat himself and then said he was wrong. The amount was close to {$800000.00} if the lowest yen to dollar amount was used for that day when the transfer was complete. 

I thanked XXXX XXXX for his help and said that I was unsatisfied with the explanation and with Wells Fargo Bank and wished I had never used them in this transaction. I said that my confidence in their treatment of my account was severely changed and that doing future business with them was impacted negatively. I added that I hoped a manager or boss of XXXX XXXX would review my complaint. 
He said they would. 
The whole conversation was recorded. 


XX/XX/XXXX Wrote a secure email to Wells Fargo saying that the difference between what $ were deposited in my account and the conversion rate for that day was over {$16000.00} I said I had lost faith in Wells Fargo to deal fairly and wanted answers. 

Here is the email : Reference # XXXX. I have not heard back from you concerning my wire transfer from the XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative who responded to my original email request for an explanation of the conversion of yen to U.S dollars gave atartlingly incorrect and lengthy explanation of traveling and purchasing items in XXXX and the fees involved. I have no faith in Wells Fargo to have handle my simple wire transfer ethically and with a mind to keeping my business. 
The rate of exchange for that day was XXXX yen to {$1.00}. XXXX Yen/ {$1.00} XXXX Yen = {$800000.00} On my Wells Fargo account the conversion is only for {$780000.00}. The difference is {$16000.00}. Wells Fargo charged me a huge amount of money for something. You either charged me for a purchase I did not make, a use of funds in a manner that did not happen, fees that were not disclosed to me or a far worse conversion rate of yen to dollars. 

I need a response.

That is a difference of {$16000.00} that I did NOT get because XXXX Yen per $! was used. 
XXXX Yen / {$1.00} XXXX Yen = XXXX I want to lodge a formal complaint starting with Wells Fargo Bank officials. 
I think they used the worst possible conversion rate on that day and somehow covered up the real transaction amount by compiling my funds with other funds, converting them for more U.S. dollars and then hiding the actual transfer in paperwork I am not privy to. The amount they gave me in my account was the worst possible rate fro that day and they profited on my Yen transfer because no one is keeping tabs on their movement of funds and conversions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed that I did not want to receive a phone call from the executive office but wanted a response in writing. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX,  I received a letter from Wells Fargo : Dated XX/XX/XXXX Case Reference XXXX Transaction Amount {$780000.00} Work of Date XX/XX/XXXX Our records show Wells Fargo received XXXX XXXX Yen at the current exchange rate of XXXX resulting in a credit to your account for {$780000.00}. For any further assistance please contact directly our Foreign Exchange Wire services at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

I searched the Wells Fargo Website on my online account for any information on wire transfer regulations and found nothing. I searched for the general terms and agreements on my account and found nothing. I searched for terms and agreements on currency conversions and found nothing. There is no way I could have understood the conditions of receiving the Yen into my bank account. The manager of the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX branch did not direct me to read any terms and conditions. I informed her of the upcoming wire transfer in Yen and all she told me was that it would be a {$15.00} fee no matter how much Yen was transferred. I asked if the bank performed any special tasks to receive the funds and she said no that the bank received millions of large transfers daily and that there was nothing special for me to do or know. 
Wells Fargo did not inform me of the conversion rate before they applied it. 
They are known for fraudulently setting up accounts in people 's names that did not request those accounts. Now, I believe they make fraudulent conversions of foreign wire transfers and mix up the paper trail to cover their manuevers.

"My friend and I both have coinbase accounts. He gave me the corresponding email linked to his account so I could send him some ethereum, but he had n't realized he gave me the wrong email ( he gave me XXXXXXXXXXXX address when he XXXXXXXXXXXX address ) until after I had sent the transaction. The email that the transaction was sent to was not a valid email/not in use at this time. So, my friend created the gmail account and corresponding coinbase account to retrieve the funds, but they were n't there either. My account shows the transaction as Complete, but when running a report of my transactions it does not provide a transaction id. Spent an hour & a half on hold before getting ahold of support and when I told the guy that there is no transaction id and it 's like the funds disappeared into thin air he just said "" Yeah, I do see that, that is weird. '' Then he just hangs up on me! I 've sent emails to all support staff email addresses that are publicly available.

XXXX 's solution was "" If you sent digital currency from your XXXX account to an email address by accident, your funds will be returned to you in 30 days if the funds remain unclaimed. If the email address has not already been claimed, you could do so to ensure the funds are returned to you. '' Which I already knew and had explicitly stated I wanted to get MY funds back sooner than having to wait the 30 days.

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I received an incoming bitcoin transfer in the amount of XXXX in bitcoins. 

Within an hour the money should have become available to me because there were over XXXX confirmations. The transaction was still "" pending '' in my account which means I have no access to it. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I opened a case and asked them what 's going on. I did n't hear anything. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I asked again what 's going on. Within 3 minutes I get a response back about network congestion and transaction fees which is not related to my issue. It seems like just a cut and paste reply. 

I reply a few hours later explaining this is not what is wrong in my case and provided them with details of my transaction and why I am sure it is something on their end. 

I hear nothing. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I write to them again asking for an update and explaining that this is something on their end. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I ask them again to please correct this error. I also try calling their customer support number but it tells me they are too busy and it hangs up on me. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I call the customer service number again and this time XXXX press 1XXXX which is an option to press if you think your account is hacked. This gets me through to someone after some time on hold. 

Customer service looks into my issue and agrees there is something wrong and they said they made a new case for me to the payments department and put the priority to 10. They said my old case was a priority 1 since it was in the general pool of cases. 

I see the new case has been opened in my account. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I reply to my old case telling them I 'm still waiting. I get another cut and paste reply about high traffic and website outages which again, is not related to my case. This reply was also dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for some reason but is listed after my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX message to them. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I reply to my new case asking if there are any updates.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,1

"Coinbase is a digital currency exchange. They promised all customers that held any amount of bitcoin on their exchange on XX/XX/XXXX that they would be credited with the same amount of bitcoin cash by XX/XX/XXXX. Customers had a choice of storing their bitcoin in a "" digital wallet '' or in Coinbase 's secure "" multi-sig vault. '' Coinbase pushed customers to store their funds in the "" multi-sig vault, '' as the vault was advertised as extremely safe. 

I had 1.9+ bitcoin 's stored in Coinbase 's multi-sig vault on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Coinbase added bitcoin cash to their exchange and credited all customers who stored their bitcoin in a digital wallet on coinbase 's exchange on XX/XX/XXXX. However, they did not credit any customer who stored their bitcoin in coinbase 's multi-sig vault. On XX/XX/XXXX, coinbase emailed me stating that they have credited everyone, accept people who stored their bitcoin cash in the multi-sig vault. They stated that they are having technical issues and their engineer team is working on the issues. They provided no timetable as to when I will receive my bitcoin cash. 

I have emailed Coinbase 4 times ( without receiving a response ) and I 've spoken to customer service reps/managers at least 5 times since XX/XX/XXXX. Nobody can provide me an answer as to when I will have my money and they just state that the issue is being worked on. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, bitcoin cash was worth between {$3500.00} and {$5000.00} a coin. Today, bitcoin cash is worth {$2600.00} a coin. Coinbase created an unfair market and allowed customers to sell their bitcoin cash on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for {$3500.00} to {$5000.00}, whereas, I was not provided this opportunity. Coinbase has essentially stolen my bitcoin cash and my ability to make money trading other digital currencies. I was planning on selling my coins as soon as I had access to them. If I would have been credited with my bitcoin cash on XX/XX/XXXX, just like the majority of customers, I would have sold at {$5000.00} a coin, for a total of {$9500.00}. If I was credited with my bitcoin cash today, and sold, I would receive {$4900.00}. Coinbase has cost me at least {$4600.00}, due to their unethical business practices. 

Coinbase has not provided any additional information in 23 days, and they will not release my money to me. Before coinbase added Bitcoin cash and credited customers storing their bitcoin cash in a digital wallet on coinbase, they knew they would not be able to credit customers who stored their bitcoin cash in the multi-sig vault. Yet, Coinbase made the unethical decision to add the digital currency to the exchange and to credit some customers. This is an unfair business practice and very shady.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,0
"Wiring funds domestically or internationally should not be this difficult for a tax paying, law abiding citizen. The foreign entity used is simply incompetent in computing a successful transaction. 

On XX/XX/XXXX {$2500.00} USD were wired to my biological sister for a surprise gift to my nephew who just graduated XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my sister called to say that the funds were not available to her. Upon calling Moneygram on XX/XX/XXXX, a customer service representative who called himself XXXX explained that he needed to verify a few things : My full name, address, name of a highway near my home, my age, the receiver 's name, age and purpose of the money. All of this information was provided to the customer service representative. 

This form of questioning was quite perplexing. I told XXXX that I'd been using Moneygram for over 20 years -wiring to XXXX , XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.The reputation of my use of this company should vouch for itself. I have had to verify the funds wired internationally and I greatly appreciate that. But this domestic transfer questioning was too extreme. 

XXXX asked me if I was comfortable with him asking the questions. I asked him what does my being comfortable have to do with my sister being able to pick up the funds I wired her. He said, "" If you are not comfortable with my questions, I will refund you your money. '' I told him that I will answer the questions ( as I did ) so that my sister can pick up the funds. But the questions are a bit extreme. I even laughed about that. 

XXXX became defensive and stated that "" Since I ( the customer ) am not comfortable with the questions he ( XXXX ) is asking, then he will refund me my money. '' Again, I told him that I really wanted my sister to collect the funds to day for nephew 's surprise gift. XXXX refused to complete his interrogation. So I asked him to allow me to speak with his supervisor. He said he would allow me to speak with someone AFTER he refunds the money. 

I REALLY FEEL THAT IF THIS SITUATION WAS HANDLED BY DOMESTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES, I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THIS KIND OF AN ISSUE. XXXX was not professional. He did not have good customer service skills. He refused to assist me in a professional manner. 

I contacted moneygram immediately after this disappointing situation. After explaining that I needed to make formal complaint and being placed on hold for 4 minutes, the first called was dropped. The second call was answered by a nice lady by the name of XXXX. She listened to my complaint and requested that I hold so she could transfer me to someone. I was transferred to XXXX who said that he was not a supervisor but a equal to XXXX. XXXX and XXXX apologized for XXXX 's impromptu decision to refund the transaction. XXXX told me that I can complain on the online moneygram site. 

Wiring funds domestically or internationally should not be this difficult for a tax paying, law abiding citizen. Perhaps the federal government should only allow wire transfers to be completed by banks regulated by the federal government.

"I rented a vacation rental for 3 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX from someone on XXXX. I signed a contract and paid through PayPal. When I showed up to the property on XX/XX/2018, the person I was in contact with never showed up. I came to find out by a neighbor that the property was not owned by the person who I had a contract and paid, nor was it a rental property. I went to the local police station and filed a police report. 

After that I contacted PayPal to put a dispute in since I paid through there. I was told it would take 10 days. Within the 10 days I went into my PayPal account and noticed there were no open cases, so I contacted them. I was told that the person I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX was incorrect and I didn't have a case since I paid "" Friends & Family ''. Apparently there is no insurance when paid this way, hence the reason why I was instructed to do so, I didn't know otherwise since I don't use PayPal too often. I was then instructed to contact my financial institution since the funds came from my checking account. I filed a dispute through my bank, which was denied. I spoke to a supervisor with XXXX who was going to try and contact PayPal. After a week, I was notified by the supervisor that they were not able to get anywhere with PayPal. 

I do want to note that I did try to contact the person who set up the fraud with the two email addresses I had ( XXXX and XXXX ). I also attempted to contact the person through the initial XXXX ad, but it had since been removed.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,1
"I recently got off the phone with my previous employer, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, on XX/XX/XXXX in attempts of starting my rollover process only to find out that they closed my account. I spoke to XXXX, the current holder of my 401k, prior to this conversation to begin the process and had everything done and finished with them. The representative was so kind to even guide me through their website, helping me make any adjustments necessary to match my needs and start my rollover. I only needed to speak to Wells Fago. 

So I spoke to Wells Fargo. Again. 

I actually spoke to a representative on XX/XX/XXXX to begin the process, but the representative wasn't very willing to help me out. Only a few minutes was spent on the call as I explained to the representative that I was unable to log into my retirement account. I've tried logging in multiple times but each time it would spring up as an unknown error and to call the representative. When I called, the representative told me to simply go onto the main webpage and enroll there since I didn't officially have any Wells Fargo accounts. I only had a team member account, one that I quickly realized that I no longer have access to. 

Without further help on the matter or any attempt to help start my rollover right then and there, she disconnected and I went online to register. I ended up being unable to register due to some technical error in the system, I ended up doing the same thing that I'd attempted to do earlier, and even now the issue remains unresolved. 

I decided to try again and give Wells Fargo a call again today, XX/XX/XXXX. After being transfered from representative to representative, I was able to talk to someone who was able to pull up my account, although it wasn't very much of a conversation. She told me that I was issued a check just a few days earlier, XX/XX/XXXX, a week after my attempt to begin my rollover with the other representative. Informing me that my previous balance was now cut by a few hundred dollars and that I will be charged penalty fees for not meeting the deadline that I was never informed of. 

I remained patient and willing to wait as she looked up my files and asked her if there was anything I could do to get the rollover started since I've spoken to the representative before and had issues logging in but the representative remained stern and gave me no further options. At the end of the conversation, she had the audacity to ask whether or not I was willing to start a retirement account with Wells Fargo and that she'd be happy to help me start one. 

Throughout the entire process I felt as though I received no help at all from Wells Fargo on the matter, I was only turned to opening new accounts with them each time. Unaware and uninformed, Wells Fargo stripped me of the money that I've been building with them as a dedicated team member.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,1
I was trying to add a new number to my Coinbase account since my att account was suspended and I got a new number.I called their customer support on XX/XX/18 at around XXXX for help. The rep told me to reset my password and in doing so I was locked out of my account for 2 weeks. They said someone would contact me so I could get my new number on their but that never happened ( what a surprise ) .only way I could access to my Coinbase account was to restore my old number so I payed {$270.00} to get my service back.

"I use MoneyGram to send money to my relatives in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) several times per year. My most recent transfer was on XX/XX/2018. MoneyGram promises a free phone call for the sender to inform the recipient about the transfer and to give the recipient the "" Reference Number '' for the transfer. When I was about to make the free phone call, I noticed that my receipt did not show the information for the free phone call. The XXXX # plus the PIN that's needed to make the phone call were missing. 
The MoneyGram Receipt Jacket has printed instructions on how to make the phone call, and includes the MoneyGram Customer Service phone number. I called the MoneyGram Customer Service phone number to get the PIN number so I could complete the free phone call. I spent more than 15 minutes being taken through several menu items, none of which applied to my issue. When I finally got to speak to a live person, he informed me that I had the wrong number. He gave me a new number for MoneyGram Customer Service ( different from the customer service number on the receipt and on the receipt jacket ). The person who responded to this second number, told me that he could not give me a PIN number, and that I have to go back to the agency ( XXXX XXXX   ) where I made the money transfer. 
When I contacted XXXX XXXX, they said they do not control the giving out of the PIN numbers, or what's printed on the receipt. All this is controlled by MoneyGram. XXXX XXXX took my information and contacted MoneyGram for an explanation of the situation. XXXX XXXX told me that MoneyGram informed them that they had discontinued the free phone calls from XX/XX/2018. However, I found this to be untrue because I sent money from the same agency on XX/XX/2018, and got the free phone call then. There was no notice that the free phone call would be discontinued. 
I find that whenever I need to contact MoneyGram Customer Service, they usually provide false information. They usually give the customer the run-around to avoid taking responsibility for solving a problem. If MoneyGram does not improve on the way they treat customers, they should not be allowed to continue doing business. I pay them {$9.00} to send {$150.00}, and they pay a very low exchange rate in the destination country. So they are making money on both ends. At least, if they discontinue the free phone call, they should have the decency to be upfront with that information, and not mislead customers.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,1

I made 6 transfers. 3 transfers from XXXX ( an instant money transfer service ) to the email id the Fraud person gave me. The email id I transferred the money to was XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ).

On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX dollar check the fraud person sent to me was withdrawn from my account. 

I called my bank- PNC on XX/XX/XXXX. I told the bank what had happened. The person I spoke to was XXXX XXXX ( who is in the retail team of PNC ). He told me that once they know why the check was withdraw they can help me file a fraud case. He asked me to call him on XX/XX/XXXX. He also mentioned that he will call me. 

I didn't get any call from him. I tried calling him many times on XX/XX/XXXX but he didn't answer the call. I left voice messages but he didn't respond. Then I called another customer service member at PNC and they basically told me that they can't file a fraud because I authorized the payments. They said they are sorry that someone in their team gave me incorrect information about helping file a case but they said sorry. 

I filed a police complaint on XX/XX/XXXX.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,0

"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I sent money from my checking account ( XXXX Bank, XXXX, Texas ) to an XXXX bank account using the website Xoom.com. The money got deposited in the XXXX bank account alright, but it supposedly got rejected by my American account ( the aforementioned XXXX XXXX account ). 

Now Xoom.com is threatening me with legal steps if I do n't pay the entire amount ( approx. XXXX XXXX dollars ) to them IMMEDIATELY. 

But 1. I do n't have ( like I LITERALLY do n't have ) XXXX XXXX dollars right now, even if someone holds a XXXX to my head or something! 


2. I 've explicitly told Xoom ( in writing ) that I fully intend to pay back the entire amount to them ASAP. But the best I can do is pay it in monthly installments of {$300.00} or {$400.00} ( at most ). But Xoom rejected my proposal and is continuing to harass me. 


3. Since the transactions had perfectly gone through at that point of time ( on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), I had naturally assumed that everything was settled, Xoom and I were good, and there was nothing else to take care of. I thus planned my finances accordingly and made other expenditures thereafter. 

Now if Xoom suddenly comes knocking on my door, how am I supposed to conjure the money out of thin air?! Especially when the amount is equal to five entire months ' worth of my ENTIRE salary!!! 


4. During the original transactions on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, if the money had n't indeed cleared from the source account ( my XXXX XXXX account ), how the XXXX did it land up in the destination account ( the XXXX recipient account )?? Is n't Xoom itself supposed to ensure that nothing of this sort happens?! If Xoom did n't have the money from the customer ( myself in this case ) to begin with, then why did n't it decline the transaction in the first place??!!! I mean, like, any online merchant would do if you try to make a purchase with your credit card that will result in your credit limit being exceeded?!! Such declined transactions take place all the time, are n't they?!! Then why did n't Xoom do itself and me the favor of declining the transactions for which it 's now harassing me?!! 

I mean, if an ordinary citizen has to keep track of all the mundane arithmetic related to his/her finances, then what 're the banks / financial institutions there for?! To rip money off the ordinary citizen and to make the economy come crashing down ( like in XXXX ) from time to time? 


5. I 'm a XXXX living on my XXXX of XXXX XXXX dollars per month. {$300.00} or {$400.00} per month is the maximum amount I can spare to pay off the supposed "" debt '' or whatever it 's called by Xoom. I 'm an honest, conscientious, industrious ( I have a GPA of XXXX at school as well as XXXX ) person. I do n't want to be living with a debt either, but I ca n't come up with money that I do n't have ( that is, the money that I do n't earn in this first place! ) I 'm sticking with my assurance to Xoom that I 'll pay back the entire amount as soon as I can, but if it continues to hold a XXXX to my head ( figuratively speaking ), I 'd LITERALLY have to XXXX.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,0

She completed the whole transaction in the system and as she was writing my name down I noticed a spelling mistake, my last name was spelled as XXXX instead of XXXX so I told her to make the correction. It was at this moment when she found out that the sending agent has mispelled my last name so she called western union customer support. They told her not to pay out and gave her a case reference number which is # XXXX. The agent told me she can't pay the money and I need to provide this case number to the sender and tell them to make the correction but she never voided the transaction though I asked her what will happen with the transaction you just made, she said I can void it.I provided the case reference number to the sender and the agent location there claimed that it shows in the system that the money has already been picked, there's no way they can help with anything. I called western union customer support center on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, than again at XXXX, again at XXXX, than again at XXXX, the agents kept saying they don't have a solution and I should wait till 24 hour is completed from the time of inquiry made.

"This complaint is regarding a dispute that an XXXX purchaser opened against me. The dispute was filed in error ; the buyer provided written documentation to that effect and stated that he was working to reverse the mistaken fraud report that had been filed previously. 

Paypal was provided with ample documentation to this effect on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Documentation included : 1. Written documentation from the buyer attesting to the mistaken fraud report.

2. Tracking information indicating that the item had been delivered.

3. Positive feedback on XXXX from the seller indicating that the item was as described. 

Initially, Paypal even tried to charge me an additional {$20.00} chargeback fee before I called and complained ; they subsequently reversed the charge.

2. Paypal should remove the negative balance on my account, as the case against me was filed in error and written documentation confirms this.

3. Paypal should issue a written apology to me for its repeated failure to act in my best interest in this dispute.

4. When there is an open dispute that results in a negative balance, Paypal should NOT issue threatening email communications to customers demanding payment, especially before the dispute is closed.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",0,1

"I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, am a XXXX XXXX. I represent a client in XXXX who is the victim of a socially engineered spearphishing attack. My client 's daughter 's email account was hacked, and the hackers were able to look through her email history and learn she will be getting married in XX/XX/XXXX. Using her email account, the hackers sent an email to my client posing as his daughter and asked for money to help pay for wedding expenses. My client responded by email and agreed, and asked for bank wiring instructions. The hackers sent him instructions to wire money to a U.S. Bancorp ( US Bank ) account in XXXX XXXX, CA. On XX/XX/XXXX, my client wired {$38000.00} to the account. Almost immediately, the hackers were able to make two cash withdrawals totaling {$10000.00}.

My client realized on XX/XX/XXXX he had been scammed and alerted his bank, XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX, who contacted their correspondent bank in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX in turn contacted US Bank, at which point US Bank placed a freeze on the account in XXXX XXXX. By that time, {$19000.00} remained in the account.

Based on the two large ( {$10000.00} and {$37000.00} ) international wire transfer deposits, followed almost immediately by large cash withdrawals, it appears that US Bank failed to utilize appropriate anti-money laundering measures.

As a business owner, I have bills that were being paid out of that account. I could not place this whole account on hold because I wouldve had checks bouncing. I have 25 employees that are depending on getting paid to provide for their families, plus numerous vendors. I was then set up for an appointment at the local branch office the following morning.

The Account name is a mandatory field along with the routing number field and account number field. However, since our email and transfer instructions were hacked prior to sending the money, it ended up in a fraudulent account that had nothing to do with the company name we sent it to! Since the field is mandatory, yet is n't being checked, Bank of America is complicit in the fraud and is actually deceiving their own customers in thinking the money will end up in the proper account! If the Name AND the account number had to match, a huge percentage of fraud could be stoppped. But, the bad guys know the name is never checked anymore!

2 ) For some reason the transaction was repeated, so that a total of XXXX Euros was sent as 2 transactions, which completely depleted my bank account. It was not my intention to send this transaction twice.

3 ) In an attempt to get the second transaction cancelled, I requested that the money be refunded. I later cancelled this request since I had begun the process of submitting a claim to PayPal and was instructed by PayPal to do so.

Since that time, I have made over 10 calls to PayPal requesting to get my money returned. Each time I have called I have been instructed differently and told different stories. However, I was finally told that the intended recipient had to initiate the refund. He has subsequently requested that the XXXX Euros be refunded to me, as instructed by me, and was told that the transaction is now considered fraudulent and it may take 6 months to get the money to me.

I am totally frustrated by this process ; am out a lot of money ; and have not had responsible interactions with PayPal staff. On numerous occasions I have requested to speak with a manager, and each time that request has been rejected ( I am told it is notT possible ). 
Clearly, this is a not a fraudulent transaction - the recipient has not tried to withdraw the money, and I have been forthcoming in admitting that I made mistakes with the transaction. 
The money sits with PayPal ; my stepson has been more than compliant with my requests ; and I have been vigilant in trying to recoup my money. Since the money was intended to pay his college tuition, I have sent the money again with another vendor ( RIA ) without a problem.

I almost lost my house about 4 years ago and Chase Home finance worked with me thru modification. I had also asked them about dropping my interest rate from 7.25 .They replied make timely payments for a year and we 'll consider it. Its been 2 years and nothing They then used the excuse about not having a high enough credit score. So after that mom passed away I came across some cash and paid my house payment several months ahead Well Chase Is still not willing to work with me on my interest at all I have also been getting help on my credit score and Chase still has n't seem to be interested in helping me. When I gave Chase the money to get ahead several months I could of taken that money and done something else But I chose to pay Chase my house payments early. To show them Im serious about my home. Now Chase is telling me my house payment is going to increase Because of no funds in my escrow account. How is this possible especailly when Chase was paid several months ahead. I do not think Chase is handling my account correctly or handling it professionally ( escrow account and mortage ). All I want / need is to please drop my interest rate.They will not help me.,Mortgage,0,1
"On or about XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a telephone call from Wells Fargo Bank regarding an inquiry I made about a VA Mortgage. I informed the lady that I was concerned about the repeated inquiries in my credit report but she assured me that inquiries that are dated within XXXX days apart qualify as one inquiry. I was then transferred to a XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX asked me a lot of questions regarding my financial history and questions originating from the VA Lenders ' Manual. After I answered all of the questions XXXX XXXX pulled my full credit report. I was not given an opportunity to submit a written credit application, just the verbal one with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX informed me that he pulled my credit report from all XXXX credit bureaus and that he would utilize the credit score that was in the middle. He then informed me that according to such credit score, I qualify for the VA Mortgage per VA regulations regarding the credit scores of veterans. Then, XXXX XXXX informed me that I had XXXX ( XXXX ) medical delinquencies and XXXX derogatory item from XXXX. Therefore, the Wells Fargo computer system could not pre-qualify me for the VA Mortgage. XXXX XXXX thern informed that I was required to upload documents proving my assets totalling {$5900.00}, and several other kinds of documents including explanation letters concerning the medical delinquencies and the XXXX derogatory item. I implored XXXX XXXX to supply me with a credit denial letter so that I can receive a free credit report from the XXXX ( XXXX ) credit bureaus and ascertain the nature of the XXXX derogatory item that was something new that I knew nothing about prior to XXXX XXXX 's admonishment. I believe that because XXXX XXXX could not pre-qualify me because of the XXXX derogatory item and the medical delinquencies, that such action constitutes a credit denial, even though XXXX XXXX denied that fact. Therefore, I am requesting the CFPB to compel Wells Fargo to supply me with a denial letter so that I can request a free credit report from the XXXX ( XXXX ) credit bureaus instead of repeatedly having to buy them. 
Additionally. I believe that the credit scores that Wells Fargo received incorporate the medical delinquencies and XXXX derogatory items. It is not so clear to me which credit report included the XXXX derogatory item and which credit report displayed the middle credit score that Wells Fargo used to qualify me. It appears to me that Wells Fargo used the credit report with the lowest credit score, instead of the middle credit score, to deny me credit because it appears that is the credit report that showed the XXXX derogatory item. 
It is also not so clear whether these medical delinquencies and derogatory item was a component of Wells Fargo FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) pre-established creditworthiness criteria that I should have been informed about prior to the accessing of my full credit reports. I do not recollect XXXX XXXX asking me and inquiring about any derogatory items in my credit reports prior to accessing them.",Mortgage,0,0
"i am writing to seek much needed help with getting a reasonable mortgage payment amount on my mortgage.

the hurricane came in in XXXX ( XXXX ) and i got some damages which i reached out to the insurance company to take care of and they declined and threatened to cancel my policy if i did not get my whole entire home redone, tiles, roof, painting, bathrooms kitchen electrical airconditioning etc. which i have until XXXX of XXXX to provide color pictures to them after completion if not i will be cancelled.

I was placed in foreclosure by M & T bank in XXXX XXXX, XXXX but thank XXXX the Hurricane came on the XXXX so I was blessed to have them toss the foreclosure aside if i did a new modification with them. It was a pain and almost near to impossible reaching M & T Bank then finally a rep told me to call the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as they are the ones who is handling the loan it was transferred over to them. 
i have attached the agreement they sent me that i was forced to sign so i do not go into foreclosure. 
i called and spoke with XXXX XXXX who said he was going to check to see what he could do to help me with my financial strains and he sure did not. he came back with a payment schedule for 5 months of almost XXXX monthly i was floored. 
the first and only payment was XXXX which i struggled to pay but was able to do so but the 3200 monthly i cant even try to do that.

please have them give me a fair modification so i can handle my payments. this is ridiculous that the bank is trying to take my home that i have struggled so hard for and the insurance company that i am paying an escrow to every month would not fix anything in the house and force me to spend money to fix stuff they should be fixing.

"I have been working with Citibank for well over a year with regards to short sale process. First, they recommended that I apply for a loan modification from my mothers estate into my name. I did this and provided them all the information they requested, starting in XX/XX/XXXX. They then requested I deed the property from the Estate of XXXX XXXX to me personally, which was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. They then rejected my application for a loan modification, and then said I did not have time enough to apply for a short sale, and it was being sent to foreclosure. I use my first two-week adjournment on XX/XX/XXXX to postpone the foreclosure to allow enough time to apply for a short sale. I asked if I could short sell it to myself, and I specifically emphasize that it was me, and heir ( related party ) which would be unusual. The lenders rep verified with whomever is behind the curtain, and said I could do it, and I hurried to provide the necessary documents, including the contract to short sell it to myself. Again, I provided all requested info within a 24-48-hour period. After much rumination by whoever is behind the curtain, they said I could not sell it to myself, and there was not enough time and therefore they were going to go to foreclosure. So, I used my second 2-week adjournment on XX/XX/XXXX to get enough time to short sell it to a third-party. I then provided all the documents for a third-party contract for short sale within a 24-hour turnaround time. They again sat on for weeks and finally went to the negotiator or whoever is behind the curtain ( they never tell you who it is, or what their function is ), and he said that my offer was too low, and there was not enough time to negotiate and they would send it to foreclosure. This was on XXXX XXXX. Please note, I never received an actual rejection letter from them and I was only aware of this is because Ive been in constant contact with the lenders rep at least every 5 to 7 calendar days for the last six or eight months or more. CitiMortgage have been very meticulous about sending me these lengthy five page letters that are full of fluff and repetition and are a complete waste of paper. every time I send them the tiniest little document and they send out these same letters that all look very similar except for perhaps one buried sentence that might have something important to say. They will send the same letter three days in a row. However, the most important letter I could receive, would be this letter of rejection, which they never sent on any of these occasions, nor did they would never give me enough time to respond. On XXXX XXXX, they sent me a letter saying that my hardship letter application for short sale has been received, ( see attached document ) all documents were complete, and they were going to postpone the foreclosure to XXXX XXXX while they processed the short sale. On XXXX XXXX, they closed the case and said there was not enough time before the foreclosure, which is dated for XXXX XXXX, and closed the case. Again, this was never conveyed to me by either written or email, and I only found out because on Monday I had my regularly scheduled conversation with the lenders rep, XXXX XXXX, nor did they ever speak or contact my attorney, my Realtor, ( both of whom have written authorization to speak on me on my behalf ) or the third-party buyer. XXXX recommended I wait 10 minutes and call back on Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to speak to the escalation department, whatever that is, and I did, and the man said that a case was open to request a postponement of foreclosure. And I was asked to call back on Tuesday ( XXXX XXXX ), unfortunately I was too busy and didnt call back to Wednesday ( XXXX XXXX ) at which point I was told that on Tuesday ( XXXX XXXX ) they request to postpone the foreclosure had been closed and it would still go to foreclosure on XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from CitiMortgage dated XX/XX/XXXX stating effective XX/XX/XXXX, the servicing of the mortgage loan will be transferred to XXXX XXXX. I believe I am getting the bum 's rush so that they can foreclose the property and get some proceeds from the loan prior to the transfer to the new servicing company. XXXX XXXX has been contacting whoever is behind the curtain, but there have been no results to date. I know of other people who have loans with CitiMortgage, and they have suffered the same run around, get all the info in to them in 24 hours, wait forever, and they without notice, they reject it, and say not enough time before foreclosure. My tenant who currently resides in the property is an XXXX year old woman, who would be eventually left out on the streets. Also, my family will be mortified if this is what happened to my mothers home. I strongly believe that CitiMortgage is not acting in good faith, I have bent over backwards to respond within 24-48 hour timeframe for every document that they have requested. Then they ruminate on the documents for weeks or months at a time, only to be told at the last minute, that they have rejected my request and there not enough time for alternative solutions prior to the imminent foreclosure. In addition, they have never provided written acknowledgements of their decisions, which I have only found out through my constant contact with the lender through weekly phone conferences.

"Tuesday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX In XXXX XXXX I bought a home in Georgia ; this is my primary and only home. The mortgage is with 360 Mortgage XXXX ( XXXX, TX ). I have several concerns, one being my escrow account has started with a deficit every year since I purchased the home, despite the decrease in property taxes and hazard insurance by about {$95.00}, and the increase in mortgage payments last year to cover the XXXX shortage. Also, in XXXX XXXX I notified the mortgage company that effective this year, I am eligible to take advantage of the Georgia school tax exemption. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called the mortgage company to ask for an explanation about the yearly deficits in my escrow account despite the decrease in taxes. I was told an early insurance payment ( paid in XXXX instead of XXXX ) caused the shortage. Here are my questions : 1. The increase in my mortgage payment last year was to cover XXXX taxes and insurance for that year regardless of when the insurance was paid. If the XXXX analysis of the escrow account was accurate, why did the early insurance payment cause a XXXX shortage? 

2. An analysis of my account was performed XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but I am not convinced that the decrease in my taxes and insurance was taken into consideration. How can I be assured that it was? 

3. What other factors could drive my escrow balance to be short every year? 

4. In addition to the lesser taxes, will the school tax exemption help lower my monthly payments? 

5. Based on my conversation with the mortgage company, it sounds like the difference between the higher XXXX and lesser XXXX taxes were not applied to escrow. Is there a time frame the mortgage company has to issue me a check for the difference? 

Another concern is regarding the XXXX Form. As of year-XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage balance was about {$2000.00} less than the amount the mortgage company submitted to IRS.

"Chase Complaint to Banking Commission XX/XX/XXXX Bank : Chase Bank Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX Chase Relationship Manager : XXXX XXXX Phone # : XXXX Problem Statement As the seller, I have been working with Chase for several months to conclude a Chase-approved short sale attempt of our home. We, my real estate agent, my wife, and myself, have complied with every timeframe and procedural requirement of Chase.
Chase has not met its own procedural deadlines and timeframes. o They have not responded to inquires within their designated 48 hours.
o At Chases date recommendations we have had to extend close and due-diligence dates four times since the process began because they can get their own procedures done on time.
o Because the approval procedure has taken more than 120 days, Chase required a new BPO ( Broker Price Opinion ) of the home ( by its own policy ) which further delays the home sale. Currently, Chase has had the new BPO since XX/XX/XXXX. They have been unable to pass it through their internal audit as this date. We are stalled until they finalize their audit process. ( We have been stalled for 22 days. ) o We are currently 4 months, into a process which has no end in sight. o More examples are available upon request. We have received conflicting information from different Chase departments, as well as conflicting information from the same Chase individuals from one day to the next.
o While working through a Chase approved short sale approval process, at the same time, I am receiving notices of foreclosures by a different Chase department. I recently  even received a notice from a collections agency that Chase has referred our account to them. Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, a sheriff appeared to server foreclosure papers. I called the Collection Agency who informed of the following : They had no knowledge that the house was in short sale. Chase could suspend or put on hold the foreclosure process The short sale division at Chase has not told me or my real estate agent that there is a foreclosure hearing or date. For all I know, the short sale division may not even be aware of this new action. o More examples are available upon request.
I have a buyer who was prepared to pay {$140.00}, 000 over the BPO.
However, because of Chases procedural delays and in light of recently discovered damages and repair estimates of {$330000.00}, is still willing to only ask for {$100000.00} reduction in price, thus paying {$40000.00} more than the BPO.
I lost one buyer who was prepare to pay {$80000.00} which was {$160000.00} over the BPO of the
home because of the delays and frustration with the Chase procedures.
If the house goes into foreclosure, not only will my credit be more severely impacted, but Chase will now have to disclose $ 300,000+ ( material facts ) in repairs to any new buyer under the short sale structure that may significantly reduce the price that Chase can obtain in an auction. It is Chases best interest to take the current deal, ( they have already lost $ 125,000+ from the lost first deal ), but their procedures take precedent over mine, the buyers, the agents, and the banks own financial interests, as well as their shareholders interests.
Chases own procedures work against their own interests, while putting an additional burden on the buyer and seller. For example, Chase requires dates in the paperwork to be correct at EVERY stage of the process ( clerk review, file holder audit, negotiator review, credit manager audit, finance committee review, and closing department review ). We recently were informed of this requirement. When Chases own inability to meet its own procedureal deadlines occur in one stage, then the next stage of the Chase process requires new dates all of which must be resigned and initialed by the buyer and the seller.
As Chase requires new dates on the HUD, they require a new payoff to be calculated. To receive the payoff, a work order needs to be established. Procedurally, they allow themselves seven days to process the work order and thus receive the payoff amount.
We simply have a situation where a buyer and a seller wish to conduct a free enterprise deal, but is held up by Chase bureaucracy.
Impact 1. Me and my family a. As this transaction moves from short sale to foreclosure, the impact is more onerous and financially damaging to my personal situation. b. The stress on my family, my XXXX wife, in particular, is becoming overwhelming. c. The planning and actual process of moving out of the home has had to be changed numerous times, creating confusion, frustration, expenses and rescheduling. d. As this transaction moves from short sale to foreclosure, the impact is more onerous and financially damaging to my personal situation. 2. The Buyer a. The buyer has {$75000.00} tied up in earnest money, missing the current opportunity in the stock market. b. Increased damage and liability to the buyer as the water-damage related defects continue to be exposed to the elements. XXXX recently receive 8 inches of rain in a three-day period that continued to undermine the structure of the house and continue to place great hydrostatic pressure on a failing retaining wall. Until the deal is completed, much needed water-related repairs can not occur, which only reduces the worth of the home. c. Because of the bureaucracy and delays, the second buyer is considering withdrawing his offer.
3. The Agents a. Loss of commissions ( {$40000.00} ) after hundreds of hours of work trying to comply with Chases short sale process. My agent has been informed that if foreclosure goes through, rather than short sale, the agents receive nothing for their efforts. 4. Chase and its Shareholders a. These Chase delays and procedures have already cost Chase a substantial amount of money ( $ 125,000+ ), but they have said that their procedures are more important than any of their own, agents, buyers, or our financial concerns. b. As a result of these delays, the newly identified defects will now have be disclosed as material facts to any future buyers, resulting in the financial detriment to Chase and its shareholders. Brief History My wife and I have lived at the home listed above since XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my income from my job was significantly reduced, family and business financial problems, and substantial medical payments for my wifes  XXXX treatments, grew overwhelming and it became clear we needed to downsize immediately because we could no longer make the mortgage payments. We looked at selling the house, but an analysis of the local market for houses similar to ours, were taking 1-2 years when the houses were in average market condition time and money we did not have. Because of our financial circumstances, needed repairs to the house had gone unattended ( deferred maintenance ). In XX/XX/XXXX, we put up the house for sale, in an as is condition. Chase sent us the first of several intent to foreclose in the future notices. We contacted the bank about a short sale option. They had an BPO completed which concluded a dollar amount of {$630000.00}. The principle loan balance left on the account was {$920000.00}. We listed the home {$60000.00} over Chases BPO and received five offers, all above the BPO amounts the highest of which was {$160000.00} over their BPO. On XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted the highest offer of {$800000.00} to Chase because Chases policy only allows one offer to be submitted at a time. The other four offers became back-ups. We completed the seller requirements on the contract  within Chases designated timeframe ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and have consistently maintained an active short sale contract in Chases system since that time.
Conclusion 1. Im a seller who wants to sell.
2. I have ready, willing and able buyers who are ready to buy over the BPO price.
3. We have complied with Chases requirements for documents and date extensions, in a far more timely manner that they have responded to their own timeframe requirements. 4. If foreclosure was more advantageous to Chase, then I mig
ht understand why everyone else must suffer. However, it seems to me that short sale is in EVERYONES best interest. The only one to lose is an inanimate bureaucratic process whose procedures can not be met by the best efforts of real people and disadvantages everyone else.",Mortgage,0,0

We were told that XXXX was on another call and we were put on hold. We were on hold for 1 hour 25 minutes with Charity. She would come on the line and ask if we would like to be called back or leave a voice mail. We declined due to the number of different people we had talked to previously. At one point, XXXX came on the line and told us we would have to hang up because they were receiving an unusual number of phone calls and we were tying up their line. Again, we declined to hang up. Finally, XXXX XXXX had to get off the phone to go to another job. I called XXXX at XXXX and left a voice message but never received a call back. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, my husband called PennyMacs corporate headquarters. After being passed off to 2 different people, a 3rd person asked to speak with me. I asked her name and it was XXXX XXXX. I declined to talk to her again and XXXX was still unavailable. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX XXXX and I called PennyMac to talk to a supervisor. We were informed there was no supervisor there that day and the team leader was away from their desk. During our 47 minutes of being on hold and talking, XXXX XXXX asked if we could just have the dates of the notices of when I had been informed of having no insurance. She gave the notice dates of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Then on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, she stated enforced hazard insurance had been put in place from my escrow account in the amount of {$1100.00}. 
XXXX XXXX restated the dates to me after PennyMac hung up and told me to call the Better Business Bureau, Utahs Attorney General, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to get someone to intervene on my behalf. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to see if PennyMac had purchased a policy for me and to get a declaration page. I was told to call XXXX XXXX. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the BBB. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I spoke to a representative who could only find my current policy on file. He wanted to be sure so he transferred my call to XXXX. XXXX verified my current policy but could find no record of PennyMac purchasing a policy for the year XXXX. She suggested I call my insurance agent. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX. He told me he could not find a record of a policy but that it would not show up since PennyMac would have used another insurance agency. I told him that the email said they had used the same insurance company and the same policy number as I had purchased from him on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received an email from the BBB with a response from PennyMac that stated : Upon receipt of the BBB notification, our office is in the process of completing a thorough review of XXXX XXXX loan to ensure that her concerns are addressed. PennyMacs representative will send a written response in regards to researching his concerns as the issue is currently being researched and will be resolved. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I rejected this response due to the fact that I had not been able to find any proof from the insurance company that PennyMac had purchased insurance for me. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I called the Utah Attorney General office at XXXX and left a message.

He stated that he would call me around XXXX on Tuesday with some kind of information about my case. He gave his number XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and an email ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ). 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, I received a call and voice message from XXXX with the Attorney Generals office. I returned the call at XXXX and spoke to XXXX about what information I needed to include. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX, I received another email from the BBB with the exact same response from PennyMac as the email from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I rejected this response because I do not have a resolution in writing from PennyMac.

"In XXXX 2015, I started using the Nationstar Mortgage website to make payments. ( XXXX ). 

When making a payment, the website will confirm if you will be charged any fees based on the payment date you select. You receive both a confirmation through the website and afterwards via email confirming the total amount that will be deducted from your bank account. 

In XXXX 2015, I selected a payment date of XXXX/XXXX/15. The online payment confirmation screen gave no notification I would be charged any fees. The email confirmation showed I would not be charged any fee. However, upon checking my bank statement, the withdrawal was {$9.00} more than what my confirmation statement showed. 
When I logged into my online Nationstar Mortgage account, a fee of {$9.00} was charged on that transaction that was not shown on my payment confirmation. 

In their online payment system, if you select certain dates the payment system shows on the confirmation screen that a charge of {$9.00} would be applied. In XXXX when I submitted my payment, I intentionally selected a date that did NOT populate the {$9.00} fee. 

Also, when scheduling my XXXX payment, there was a new notification box that popped up advising me that a fee was being waived because I am a new Nationstar member. I am clearly not a "" new '' member. 

When I called Nationstar Mortgage I was advised that anytime you make a payment after 9 days, you will be charged a late fee that does not show up on the confirmation. However, the screen shot today clearly shows the fee does show up on the confirmation, and the fee always previously showed up on the confirmation as well. 

My confirmation statement from XXXX clearly confirms I would not be charged any fee. I have also frequently submitted payments to be paid on the XXXX of the month without ever incurring the fee before as proven by my transaction history. 

When I pushed the CSR for who I could submit a complaint to that was not Nationstar ( what agency regulates mortgage companies ) I was told "" no one ''. I then advised the CSR to ask their supervisor and after a very long hold the CSR returned to again advise me there was no one other than Nationstar to submit the complaint to. 

I informed the CSR I found an agency to submit the complaint to, and requested a refund of the {$9.00}. I also asked for my XX/XX/XXXX draft be canceled so I could reschedule it because from what the CSR told me, even though the online website and confirmation email advised me there would be no fee, because of my date selected I would expect another {$9.00} fee at the time of withdrawal. 

I asked the {$9.00} fee for XX/XX/XXXX to be waived. CSR advised could request but could make a guarantee of refund.I requested a supervisor. After another long hold I spoke to Supervisor XXXX ( ID XXXX ). I advised I was submitting this complaint, she requested I send a copy to their complaint dept and I agreed. I advised their website has always informed me of the {$9.00} fee and I have always deliberately scheduled my payment to avoid it. I also informed her of the "" fee waived '' message today. She did submit a request to waive my {$9.00} fee and I wanted it put back into the bank account they drafted it from. She called me back today to inform me they can not do that and instead will have to overnight a check. 

My concern is for consumers who live paycheck to paycheck and how this impacts them when fees are taken out above and beyond what the mortgage company confirms they will draft. I have another home loan through another mortgage company and Nationstar is the ONLY mortgage company that has informed me they can charge a fee AFTER a confirmation of payment that would change the amount drafted from a bank account. This is a dishonest practice and full disclosure of all fees AT TIME OF SCHEDULED payment should be disclosed CLEARLY.",Mortgage,0,0

"To Whom It May Concern, This letter is to inform of misconduct and poor business practice on the part of our mortgage company, Caliber Home Loans. 
Three years ago, new to the area, we chose Caliber as our mortgage company on the advice of our realtor.

In XXXX 2016, we received word that Caliber Home Loans was incorporated and we were to hence forth send our checks to XXXX Texas. The local office was closed. 
On XXXX, XXXX 2016, I received a call from a representative of Caliber stating my check had not arrived. 
While on the phone line I reviewed my internet checking and discovered the check had indeed arrived at the post office in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The man assured me they had not received it and ask me to stop payment on the check and wire their payment. 
I drove straight to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( FCU ) and requested a stop payment on my check. 
While in line at the FCU to wire the funds I checked my Caliber account on my phone and lo and behold the check had been received. 
I immediately returned to the bank officer and cancelled the stop payment and returned home and called Caliber to inquire about the payment. They confirmed receiving the check. 
Two days later Caliber called back and stated they had not received my check. 
I explained in detail what had occurred and they at first suggested the check had insufficient funds and then after heated discussion suggested the check was a "" stop payment. '' I contacted my XXXX and they assured me no one had ever attempted to deposit my check. 
I again contacted Caliber demanding to speak to a manager and expressed concerns about the company 's accounting practices endangering our credit rating. 
She was very rude, offering to email me a link to XXXX. I suggested that perhaps she needed the credit counseling. 
She finally informed me that even though they had never submitted the check for payment it had ( inadvertently I assume ) been stamped "" stop payment '' and they would require another check and assured me my original check would be returned to me ( it never was ). 
She also assured me the incident would not be reflected on our credit.

"During the height of the Mortgage Fraud scandal period ( XXXX ), I bought a house during the same year court proceedings for my divorce was happening, from CHASE bank. In XXXX, I discovered that Chase had paid huge fines to the Federal government for conducting fraudulent practices that had a disparate impact on Minority communities. Being an XXXX Veteran, I wanted to ensure that I was n't impacted unfairly by this. However, by late XXXX, after obtaining my XXXX, I was had to resign from a company I was working with due to a Martial Arts demonstration injury due to improper stretching procedures prior to the event. This placed me in a 6-month rehabilitation situation, during which time I fell behind on payments to Chase. I informed them of my situation and my desire to do a Loan Modification upon rehab. They agreed, however, the terms of the Modification got weird when I made payments ahead of the stipulated deadline, however, it was n't credited to that account and instead, I was placed in an immediate breach situation. When I was told of this, I called back to the office that alerted me of the situation and the people I had been dealing with, sending paperwork to, somehow were unable to be found within Chase, the numbers did n't work for any of them anymore, and the office itself did n't exist to the people I could speak with in other offices. So, we started from scratch in XXXX and by now a Veterans association told me that I should attempt to ask for a Special Forbearance Modification, since I met the criteria for that. They spoke of many people who were in similar situations who were granted this for 6 months usually, which would have been perfect for me. I did n't feel that this was unreasonable, since before the accident, I had never been late on any payments, even while XXXX. As a retiree now, this was something that I assumed I earned from them. However, that request was denied and the Foreclosure process was to go forward in XX/XX/XXXX. Near the beginning of the year, I was approached by a Law firm stating they had reason to believe that my original contract was invalid and fraudulent. They also informed me that Chase received huge Federal bailouts during the Great Recession. However, the flaw in that practice was the government was giving these banks bailouts, but allowing them to continue the same practices that caused the crisis in the first place, without any oversight to ensure fairness. This seems to explain how a seemingly arbitrary, subjective decision from decision makers within Chase, would deny my request for Special Forbearance, but grant it to others. The fact that their decisions resulted in a disparate impact on Minorities seems to me, grounds to ensure that some oversight be placed into the process. However, my next step was to save my home since by this time, after some troubling exploitative experiences with Corporate America after my injury was resolved, I decided to start my own Business. I then attempted to hire a Home Servicing service, with expertise in legally informing and assisting Home owners with retaining their homes. They did seem to get something done, since two-three months in, Chase sold the contract to another Loan company. However, this company was n't working with them, as they promised, and turned out to be a fraudulent company themselves, since I received additional legal counsel outside of them, that to ask for payment in advance was unlawful, and I did pay them in that manner. However, this complaint is n't against them now, it 's about going after Chase, with their fraudulent practices and contract that the New Loan company is trying to enforce. But, I fully intend to file a Complaint on the Home Servicing entity, called "" The XXXX '' very shortly after filing this one.",Mortgage,0,0

I asked them if they had contractors come give bids on my house and they bid morel than what XXXX XXXX 's quote was what would happen and they told me they would go to XXXX XXXX for more money, I then asked them if the bids came in less than what XXXX XXXX quoted, if I got the money back and I was told "" NO, that 's our money ''. They seem to forget that I have personal losses involved as well, I have property that was damaged. I have paid out for the water mitigation and drying out, yet I get no money for that whatsoever. I 'm going on 90 days of having to live like this and put my money out of my pocket on this job, that is not right. The majority of contractors get money "" up front '' before even starting the project and if I were a "" preferred '' contractor of XXXX they would have made a single copy check to me as a contractor instead of a dual check to the contractor AND the mortgage company.

"Applied for Mortgage application with Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/16. Had contract close date with the seller on XXXX/XXXX/16, mortgage company was well aware of it. All information requested on my behalf was submitted in a timely matter. Borrower did not start reviewing my application until I ran past the original contract date XXXX/XXXX/16 ( email communications on file ). Appraisal was not scheduled, my employment was not verified, and this information was not communicated to me until XXXX/XXXX/16, even though I made several attempts to reach brokers both via phone and email. 
Also, received unreasonable requests such as : My loan was approved, and was supposedly pending finalization from the underwriter. And the underwriter came back with the request to show proof of repairs that needed to be done, based on the home inspection he/she reviewed. Firstly, all the repairs were minor like a chipped wall, and an exposed wire. Secondly, they wanted me to do repairs on the house I did n't buy yet because of the application they did n't finalize yet. By this point I was fairly stressed, and I answered them saying that this is beyond insane, I 'm not fixing the house I do n't own yet. Also, I put it in writing, signed and dated. After reviewing, they came back with saying to have seller fix the house. Which I refused. And only then, they settled on a contract addendum that read nobody is fixing the exposed wire, both seller and buyer and ok with it, signed and dated. 
After doing absolutely nothing for some more days, and me calling and emailing on average 5 times a day, they came back saying they ca n't verify my employment. This is one of the main things that need to happen in the beginning. We are now 2 months, and one week into the process. They were not getting a response from XXXX, they reached out to me. To which I said this sounds about right because XXXX does n't work for us. And gave them the information of the person who does work for us. Then had to continue following up to make sure it was received. After 3 business day of them reviewing one piece of paper, and me escalating this to management, the form was approved. 

By this point seller puts the house back on the market because they 're tired of waiting. I am pleading with my mortgage brokers for mercy ( email communications available ). And finally I get a response that my loan is denied. This is the reasoning they gave me ( as understood by me ) : since my current lease begins in XXXX, they do n't have proof of residence for the last 12 months. The fact that I have another lease from before gets dismissed. And because I do n't have proof of residence for the last 12 months, I need to provide proof of additional income from the business I have n't been telling them about, with XXXX. And since I do n't have this business, the loan to debt ratio is too high, and the application will be denied. 

To which I said fine, just provide me with Loan Denial letter, and I 'll re-apply through normal bank. After again ignoring my emails and phone calls for 2 days. I just received a phone call from the broker telling me after review by one underwriter this goes into review for another underwriter and then it will be denied in 5 business days, or maybe 7, who knows. 

I just want this to be over.",Mortgage,0,1
"I had a loan with Key Bank which seemingly they became the holders of. There were either three other holders before them, as I recall. The loan was paid off back in XX/XX/XXXX.

I received only a blank XXXX with no property address or termination stated thereon and my name was incorrectly spelled. These are the collateral for the loan which originated with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore I have not received my recognition agreement, or complete loan documents. I have been calling them and complaining about this and have got finally just an incorrect XXXX, and a copy ( emphasis added ) of the adjustable rate note, loan security aggreement, and RESPA statement. 
I have told them that absent the original shares of stock and proprietary lease, and a completed filed XXXX termination notice from the county I can not sell the apartment, or do anything. Six months is more than enough time to have all this done as the original documents should have been provided to me no later than XX/XX/XXXX, and the XXXX should have been sent no later than three months from closing.",Mortgage,0,1
"We closed on an investment property in XXXX, TX in the beginning of XX/XX/2018. The original loan was for $ XXXX. The escrow should have already been set up at that point to cover all insurances, including flood insurance for the year. The original lender XXXX XXXX sold our mortgage to RoundPoint Mortgage in XX/XX/2018. 

RoundPoint on more than one occasion demonstrated terrible communication. They did not have various documents ( they kept asking for things over and over again via mail ), and did not acknowledge our new account until right before XXXX 's mortgage was due. This is relevant because they then over paid the flood insurance to FEMA in XXXX. They sent them an extra {$6200.00} from our escrow. 

RoundPoint did not inform me of their mistake. It was in fact, my insurance broker 's office ( XXXX XXXX ) who called me and told me that the mortgage servicing company had paid the flood insurance twice. FEMA sent us back an overpayment check. RoundPoint then sent me a statement in XXXX claiming escrow for the year was going to be short, and that for XXXX we were going to have to either send them {$10000.00}, or our monthly mortgage was going to increase by + $ XXXX/month. 

I called them and asked 1. ) Why was the flood insurance double paid?, and 2. ) How can the escrow be that much off when the loan is only a few months old?  Their response was literally, "" these things happen '' and "" you'd be surprised how often this sort of things happen. '' They gave no reason why the flood insurance was handled so poorly, or why the escrow was still apparently $ XXXX off from what was calculated for closing only a few months before. 

I have trouble getting them on the phone ( I'm on the XXXX coast, their offices on the XXXX coast ), and the website login doesn't give access to much account info at all. I sent the FEMA overpayment check back to RoundPoint to be put specifically into escrow but they have not informed me of any changes yet. I logged onto their terrible web interface and I see that the monthly mortgage has now been recalculated. 

So, in essence this is what happened : XX/XX/2018, close with a monthly mortgage payment of {$1700.00}. 
XX/XX/2018, loan sold to RoundPoint. 
XX/XX/2018, RoundPoint over paid flood insurance. 
XX/XX/2018, Round point says we were going to have to either send them ~ $ XXXX, or our monthly mortgage was going to increase by $ XXXX/month. 
XX/XX/2018, I get the FEMA overpayment back into escrow with RoundPoint. XX/XX/2018, RoundPoint recalculates our monthly mortgage payment to be {$2100.00}. 

Why are we being asked to pay ~ {$300.00} more a month when we only closed last XXXX? Why are they not taking responsibility for their mistake? I don't understand how the terms of the loan can change this much. I'm not sure what action to take now. 

Thank you, -XXXX XXXX",Mortgage,0,0

"I applied to refinance a loan through XXXX XXXX on or around XX/XX/2018 and I write this complaint today XX/XX/2018 over four months after my initial application to obtain a mortgage on an investment property that I own. Throughout this process. I have always had credit scores in the high 700 's to low 800 's. The LTV on  the subject property would be 70 % or less ( meaning I have plenty of equity ). Their appraisal was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX which would support my statement. I have provided documentation that I have more than enough funds as reserves. I am employed as an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of over 8 years and have provided documentation. They have been able to verify this. Throughout the process, their underwriters had many requests for me, I was able to provide documentation which satisfied their requests. After doing this, their underwriter 's requests would change and they would ask for more documentation which I provided which should have satisfied their requests. They would even verify that the documentation I provided satisfied their requests. Some of their underwriter 's requests seemed insignificant ( why did you only declare a {$1100.00} repair expense on an investment property you own when you provided receipts that show {$1400.00} in expenses. I explained that I gave the wrong amount to my accountant ) and even after I was able to prove everything out, their underwriters still say that the condition has not been cleared. Every time I satisfied their underwriter 's requests, they would then bring up new conditions or old conditions that were satisfied earlier. My DTE was under 50 % which they stated was their requirement. As time went by, they even raised my interest rate and I had to point it out before they would address it. There is no logical explanation on why we have not been able to close yet.

Dovenmuehle received the check and placed in an escrow and has not released any money at all. They sent us a letter we needed to file a certain documents including a proposal for repairs.

My concern with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is there contradictive behavior. When I explained to XXXX that I have a letter from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage condricting her statement of eligibily of loan mod she said its "" generic '' CFPB approved letter that everyone gets.

I proceded with a short sale option and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage accepted my short sale documents but after a few days of requesting documents the loan XXXX XXXX XXXX removed it. 

My complaint is the emotional and mental abuse Wells Fargo Home Mortgage has put me through by telling me what I am eligible for in writing and then contradict themselves and then tell me I can still conduct a short sale and I commit to it and then they tell me no even when timely. 

I need the CFPB to interject and reprimand Wells Fargo Home Mortgage for the deceptive games they conduct upon consumers like myself.

I will explain again so this XXXX XXXX will understands the vital importance of this document. What is the difference between a mortgage and a Promissory Note? Homebuyers sometimes think of the mortgage ( or deed of trust ) as the contract they are signing with the bank to borrow money to purchase a house, but it is the promissory note that contains the promise to repay the amount borrowed. A mortgage note ( also known as a real estate lien note, borrower 's note ) is a promissory note secured by a specified mortgage loan. Mortgage notes are a written promise to repay a specified sum of money plus interest at a specified rate and length of time to fulfill the promise. The mortgage note states the amount of debt and the rate of interest, and obligates the borrower, who signs the note, personally responsible for repayment. Without a promissory note, a foreclosing plaintiff can not show a legal injury, i.e., does not have standing to sue. Without standing, the action before the court does not qualify as a "" case or controversy '' under Article III of the constitution. Courts can only make rulings on "" cases or controversies ; '' advisory opinions are a legal nullity. Consequently, a court that purports to enter a "" judgment '' where it has no subject matter jurisdiction has in fact entered a legal nullity on its docket ; that "" judgment '' is void as a matter of law. As such, any such "" judgment '' entered where the plaintiff had no standing is open to collateral attack in any subsequent proceeding. What is more, subject matter jurisdiction can not be waived ; were that the case, parties could falsely induce courts to make binding rulings -- obviously non-sensical. In essence, the ruling upheld that those who had purchased foreclosure properties that had been illegally foreclosed upon did not in fact have title to those properties. As mention many times soon I will get back my property and soon will start my criminal case against XXXX XXXX for defrauded my property and must pay {$260000.00} very fast.

"I and my husband are victims of wrongful foreclosure filed by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we signed a Mortgage Contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, who in XX/XX/XXXX was purchased by XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to the mortgage agreement, the lender was XXXX ; and XXXX was named as a mortgagee. Based on XXXX website, our loan has inactive status with XXXX and the Servicer is XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, or more than 10 years after we signed loan agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Bank of New York Mellon filed a foreclosure case acting as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX. In support of this complaint Bank of New York attached a copy of the Note which has a stamp signature of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a well-known robo-signer and former managing Director who does not work for XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. The Note was accompanied by purported "" chain of endorsement '' signed by well-known robo-signer XXXX XXXX, XXXX "" Vice President ''. 

In XX/XX/XXXX Bank of New York already tried to file a foreclosure case against our family, XXXX, but was not able to provide any documents. 

In XX/XX/XXXX case Bank of New York Mellon recorded an Assignment from XXXX to Bank of New York. In XX/XX/XXXX case the second page from XX/XX/XXXX Assignment of Mortgage was used as purported "" chain of endorsement '' to our Note signed in XX/XX/XXXX. 

When we tried to contact Bank of New York Mellon and their Servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to request copies of original Note with full chain of assignment, they failed to provide us this documents, as well as prove that our loan was a part of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX created at least XXXX XXXX, each worth billions of mortgages. Here are no single documents in support that our loan was part of XXXX XXXX and not any other Trust. 

Moreover, Statute of Limitation already passed to collect anything on this loan long time ago under all applicable laws. Furthermore, XXXX can not accept any securities transfers after 90 days from its closing day, which was no later than XX/XX/XXXX.

"XXXX XXXX XXXX I recently purchased a house using a VA home loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX My very first loan estimate was for {$190000.00} at 4 percent interest rate with monthly principal and interest {$940.00}. My estimated closing costs were {$8400.00}.

Let me first start off by saying I had a seller credit of {$7000.00} I questioned my loan officer multiple times considering I received a few other loan worksheets with my closing costs being much lower but was told my Alterra that those were not final numbers and they would be around the same price I had been quoted for on my loan estimates. I have the emails and texts messages. I told them I was going to go with another lender and once again I was assured that the loan would be the best one I could get and those other lenders were just telling me things to get my business. 

On the XX/XX/XXXX I received another updated loan estimate with the loan amount of 4.625 % with a monthly principal and interest of {$1000.00} and my estimated monthly payment of {$1100.00}. The estimated cash to close was {$13000.00} and my cash to close was {$1400.00}. The estimated closing costs went from {$8400.00} on the first loan estimate to {$13000.00} on my last loan estimate. 
I asked again if these were final numbers and I was told no. Then my closing disclosure was sent and those numbers were My interest rate was 4.625 % and my monthly principal and interest rate was {$1000.00}. My closing costs were now {$5600.00} and I asked once again if these were final numbers and I was told no. 

We were supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX and it was pushed back two times due to the closing attorney not having the proper paperwork. They were not receiving anything from Alterra. I show up at XXXX on the XX/XX/XXXX and my realtor calls at XXXX and says come down we have a problem. On Monday I wired XXXX to close and was under the impression I would get about 2500 back from the law office. 
Seller paid XXXX in closing costs so they tell me my closing costs are now XXXX MORE on top of the XXXX I already paid. My closing costs increased nearly 400 %. They added discount points to my loan without even asking me to begin with and they charged me thousands of dollars for it. I broke down and didn't know what to do. I had to be out of my other house because the government is foreclosing on the company for fraud, my earnest money would have disappeared and I could have been sued by the sellers. I made four trips from the law office to the bank. The closing attorney still had not received half of the paperwork and when they asked to provide an explanation of the closing cost increase, Alterra  never responded. We were there for 7 hours, both realtors and the closing attorney said they have never seen anything like it in over 40 years between all of them. I ended up having to pay {$2000.00} more on top of the {$3500.00} I had already sent compared to the {$1400.00} I was supposed to pay. I had seller paid concessions of {$7000.00} and my closing costs were over {$14000.00}. I was also made to wet sign documents and not date them so Alterra could go back and date them to the day they needed them to be dated. I also have those emails. I was told it was a typo and a mistake by Alterra. 

I have had VA mortgage experts look at this loan and tell me this is the most ridiculous and abusive loan estimate they have ever seen. 
The seller credit should have covered all of my closing costs and I should have gotten back the amount I provided to the closing attorney Other lenders have concluded that my VA rate would have been 4.25 to 4.375. Alterra has the highest rates in the country. My realtor repeatedly asked for them to provide her with the loan emails and Alterra left out the important ones and said it was a server error.
The VA central office in Washington has been notified and said this is the most abusive and predatory lending practice they have ever seen. 
My credit score was run through another lender and the scenario, rate lock period, seller credit, and transaction type and your seller credit would have covered nearly ALL your closing costs and those rates would have been around .3750 % to .500 % lower than what Alterra  gave me. 
They used the seller concessions that I was offered to make them more money. They charged me a rate .625 % higher than what it should have been for a Veteran with a credit score like mine and the time I locked. 
This is a worksheet from another VA lender My Lender Origination Charges on your loan would have been : {$450.00} Appraisal {$84.00} Credit Report {$10.00} Flood Certification {$79.00} Tax Service Fee Thats it..

When you add that to the title fees, attorney, escrows, etc. Youre out of pocket cost would have been XXXX. 

I was charged {$8800.00} in lender fees on a {$190000.00} home. They used my seller credit to pay for their fees, thus making them more money and sticking me with the added costs. The {$7000.00} was more than enough to pay for all third party fees had they not charged me {$8800.00} in junk fees and 2.65 % in discount points, allegedly. 


They also gave me an XXXX  homeowners insurance policy which has a deductible of XXXX dollars. I just got a quote from XXXX for the same premium and a XXXX deductible. 
I didn't know I was getting XXXX nor did I decide on that high of a deductible. 
This is so abusive. 

The home has had nothing but massive leaks and major problems since moving in. This home is not worth {$190000.00} dollars so I want the loan rewritten with a new appraisal to cover ALL the significant defects that extremely lower the price of this house. I would have never paid XXXX for this house had the appraisal and home inspection been done correctly. This house is worth nowhere near what I paid for it.",Mortgage,0,0
"Attachment for Keybank : Foreclosure Fraud Revealed : Your Mortgage Documents Are Fake! 
Thu, XX/XX/XXXX - by XXXX XXXX you know about foreclosure fraud, the mass fabrication of mortgage documents in state courts by banks attempting to foreclose on homeowners, you may have one nagging question : Why did banks have to resort to this illegal scheme? Was it just cheaper to mock up the documents than to provide the real ones? Did banks figure they simply had enough power over regulators, politicians and the courts to get away with it? ( They were probably right about that one. ) A newly unsealed lawsuit, which banks settled in XX/XX/XXXX for {$XXXX} XXXX, actually offers a different reason, providing a key answer to one of the persistent riddles of the financial crisis and its aftermath. The lawsuit states that banks resorted to fake documents because they could not legally establish true ownership of the loans when trying to foreclose. 
This reality, which banks did not contest but instead settled out of court, means that tens of millions of mortgages in America still lack a legitimate chain of ownership, with implications far into the future. And if Congress, supported by the Obama administration, goes back to the same housing finance system, with the same corrupt private entities who broke the nation 's private property system back in business packaging mortgages, then shame on all of us. 
The XX/XX/XXXX lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in both North and South Carolina, by a white-collar fraud specialist named XXXX XXXX, on behalf of the federal government, XXXX states and XXXX cities. XXXX banks, mortgage servicers and document processing companies are named in the lawsuit, including mega-banks like XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX, who fell into foreclosure herself in XX/XX/XXXX, researched her own mortgage documents and found massive fraud ( for example, one document claimed that XXXX Bank, listed as the owner of her mortgage, acquired ownership in XX/XX/XXXX, four months after they first filed for foreclosure ). She eventually examined tens of thousands of documents, enough to piece together the entire scheme. 
A mortgage has XXXX parts : the promissory note ( the IOU from the borrower to the lender ) and the mortgage, which creates the lien on the home in case of default. During the housing bubble, banks bought loans from originators, and then ( in a process known as securitization ) enacted a series of transactions that would eventually pool thousands of mortgages into bonds, sold all over the world to public pension funds, state and municipal governments and other investors. A trustee would pool the loans and sell the securities to investors, and the investors would get an annual percentage yield on their money.XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, New York XXXX : XXXXXXXXXXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX at ( XXXX ) XXXX Committee for the Seventh Judicial DistrictAttorney Grievance XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX : Complaint False Claim Act Violation Neglect and Fraud Upon the Court Lacking Real Party of Interest Rule 17a BY XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Falsely claiming to be the owner/holder of the mortgage ; Predatory claims : TILA RESPAHAMPrelated claims & Breach of contract/breach of trial mod ( HAMP XXXX ) Debt collection claims ( state and federal ) Wrongful foreclosure Consumer protection statutes ( DTPA ) Dear : Grievance Committee for the Seventh Judicial District XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are involved in fraudulently invoking the jurisdiction of the court ; IS NOT THE HOLDER OF THE NOTE NOR ANY DEED ATTACH!

"Earlier this year following the loss of one of our primary income sources my husband and I applied for a loan modification. At the time of the modification request our loan was current and throughout the course of the loan which was originated in XXXX we have never been late.

We were verbally advised by our Dedicated Loan Specialist at the time, XXXX XXXX, that the payments for XXXX and XXXX would be put to the end of the loan and upon satisfactory completion of the trial period we would be approved for a permanent modification effective XXXX XXXX. 
As per the agreement we began the trial period in XXXX however upon the review of my husband 's credit report we realized that we had been reported as 30 days behind for the month of XXXX. As previously stated at the time of the modification request our loan was current. Per Nationstar Mortgage Company because the modified trial payment was less than the contractual amount they were required to report the loan as delinquent during the trial period. This however is contrary to the servicer guidelines for XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Per those guidelines borrowers who are current on their mortgage upon entering the trial modification period should not be reported as late. 
In addition none of the conversations that we had with Nationstar or the correspondence that we received from them regarding the trial period advised that upon accepting the terms of the modification our current loan would then be reported as delinquent for the next several months during the trial period. Surely had we been advised of the repercussions of proactively seeking help during a period of financial hardship we would have declined the modification as our credit worthiness is much more important than a {$70.00} decrease in payment. 
We have contacted Nationstar regarding the matter and they have been less than efficient and expedient in providing a resolution regarding this matter. Nationstar advised that they would send out a letter to the credit bureaus rescinding the negative reporting and in addition a hold would be placed on the loan preventing any negative reporting during the trial period. After the satisfactory completion of the trial period they would retro report the loan as current. 
As to date Nationstar has only provided a letter addressing removing the negative reporting for the month of XXXX. We are still waiting for the matter to be handled fully to include any negative reporting for XXXX.",Mortgage,0,0

"I want to file a SECOND COMPLAINT against Wells Fargo Home Mortgage for the deceitful, dishonest, and corrupt, method in which they have processed my loan modification, which resulted in another denial. I have faxed all requested and repetitive documents to the modification department for quite a lot of months, turning into several years. I was constantly transferred to different Wells Fargo representatives and agents, I believe this is clearly a violation of the HAMP Eligibility and the program codes XXXX & XXXX ( Protection Against Unnecessary Foreclosure ) - ( Suspension of Foreclosure Proceedings in Process ) and codes XXXX & XXXX ( Single Point Of Contact ). 
In XXXX, I became very ill and was diagnosed with a medical condition making it impossible for me to work causing a horrendous hardship and I got behind my mortgage payments I implored for help I was distressed and anguished This entire process has become a nightmare. I truly believed that once I followed their directive I would be approved for a modification, I have continued to plead with them and explained my difficult situation no avail. 
I was never made aware that my loan was accrued by a private investor XXXX BANK, XXXX. as Trustee for WFMBS XXXX, I do not understand why they are involve with my loan and are refusing to help me I strongly believe they are in violation of the guidelines of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of XXXX and the Foreclosure Relief Act of California XXXX SB XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX. 

In addition Wells Fargo has valued my home at a horrendous amount when in reality the properties around my home have sold for half, I presume Wells Fargo 's action is to make it unworkable, impossible to get a modification they are devious and corrupt .I have attached sale comparable of my area as proof of what I am complaining. 
I strongly believe Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is not in compliance with the government standards and codes, therefore I ask that you apply your regulatory authority and re-evaluate Wells Fargo Home Mortgage policies and their process of assisting home owners with the modification under the Making Home Affordable ( XXXX ) program, It is my believe their underlying guide lines contains misrepresentations, deception and violation of The Truth In Lending Act - TILA. this federal law was enacted in XXXX with the intention of protecting consumers in their dealings with lenders and creditors. 
Furthermore, I think Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is in violation of the guidelines of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of XXXX and the Foreclosure Relief Act of California XXXX SB XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX and I fall within the aforementioned guidelines. 

Their lack of willingness to assist home owners, specifically those who have a medical condition and have a crisis and live in desperation should not be tolerated by your organization.

"Bank of America - I have left strict instructions that I should not be called on my cell phone during business hours with BofA many times. I was involved with the Country Wide Bank of America scandal back in 2008 and have a long history with BofA. Currently, I am current on my mortgage.

"I had a massive house fire that damaged everything in my home. My kitchen was gone. The insurance company suggested I hire a professional cleaning company to work on my house, and I called them. The company failed to complete work, and were also contracted to rebuild. They never started the rebuild. This happened around XXXX 2016. Around XX/XX/XXXX we finally settled on how much they were owed and I looked for a new contractor. I could not find many, and most were very expensive. I also was told by the mortgage company that the rest of the insurance funds would be held until the house was finished. I was able to secure a contractor, but I told the mortgage company without those funds I could not pay the contractor and my mortgage at the same time. I fell behind in my mortgage payments by six months, and ended up losing my contractor because they would not finish the work without being paid. The mortgage company refused to help and continued withholding the funds. I finished the work and had the final inspection, and got the large sum they were holding, and caught back up on my mortgage, paid the constructor, and caught up elsewhere. They knew they were negatively impacting my life and health. They knew what they were doing was morally unconscionable. They claim they followed their rules. They did not. They said they could not release funds because of the contractor license and some other inspection nonsense. It was absurd. They knew the position they put me in and they did n't care!

"I recently obtained a mortgage on a parcel of land and an existing house thru Quicken Loans. The land is part of a subdivision and tax information wo n't be available until the next tax roll assessment. Until that assessment is complete, I pay out of pocket to the original owner of all of the parcels, my share of the taxes. What Quicken is doing however is forcing me to make Escrow payments equal to the tax of all of the parcels knowing that the amount is incorrect and significantly overstated. What I am told is that absent having the specific amount for my parcel, they can collect the amount of all of the parcels. And yes they know this is in error and acknowledge that it is in error. That defies all logic.",Mortgage,0,1
"On Friday, XXXX/XXXX/16, I called Quicken Loans about a potential refinancing of my existing mortgage. I explicitly told the representative what I was looking for, the term of the loan, and the minimum cash out amount that I needed ( {$140000.00} ). I told him that if the cash amount I needed was not possible, I would not be interested in refinancing since it would not serve my needs. He stated that I would be able to get the amount required, perhaps about {$5000.00} - {$7000.00} less ( which I did not object ), and the rate would be 2.99 %. He then said that he needed to "" profile me ''. I told him that I would be ok as long as the cash out amount and the rate were accurate ( emphasis on these conditions ). After he ran my credit, he said everything was fine and I would be receiving a good faith estimate shortly. To my surprise, not only the cash out amount was substantially lower - {$120000.00}, more than {$20000.00} less than what I required! - the 2.99 % rate required more than 3.5 % in points, which he did not disclose! I emailed him back twice and received no response. I feel that I was cheated during the process so he could run my credit score and initiate the application, most likely because his compensation is tied to those metrics. He should have disclosed the points and Quicken Loan 's experience in this industry should have been more than sufficient to give an approximate cash out amount based on the closing costs, at the very least that the amount would not approximate my desired outcome.",Mortgage,0,1

"We have had a home mortgage with Chase for the past 4 years. They have never calculated the impound accounts correctly and cycle back and forth between shortage and over-payment. This in itself is simply a nuisance and probable means nothing, but this past year I got upset and called them in reference and a better explanation of what was going on, and I believe I was lied to. They not only charged us the annual calculation of taxes and insurance but they added a two month premium on and above the annual total based on the "" SRTR '' ( sorry this acronym may not be correct as they would not repeat it because I insisted on knowing more about the regulation - and formally requested a written copy of it ) rules. For both - this equaled nearly {$750.00}. I asked for a copy of these rules and also requested a clarification of who the is regulating agency is, and at least a conversation with anyone who could tell me what the acronym stood for. After spending a lengthy time on hold ironically my customer service agent was not able to find anyone that knew anything about the regulation, or who is the regulating agency. 
In Summary, I believe Chase has instituted a policy to hold XXXX additional months of escrow on all their mortgages - my rough calculations based on internet information leads me to believe they are holding nearly XXXX XXXX dollars every month that belongs to their mortgage customers.

"About XXXX or XXXX years ago I was struggling to make my mortgage payments.

They basically told me that I had to default before they can help me. Throughout that time I filled many Home Modification Loan Applications and they kept denying me. They told me that they were the servicer of the loan and the bank that owned my loan did not do modifications. I still kept applying since they told me to try again. Chase mentioned to me that according to their regulations I did qualify for a modification but since the bank that owned the loan said no that there was nothing they could do to help me. Still they kept asking me to file again. I also got in touch with a company named Defend Your Mortgage. They were going to investigate as to why I was not getting a modification. I paid them {$5000.00} and in the end said I had a good case and forwarded me to a lawyer to assist me. That lawyer asked me to pay him {$1700.00} a month ( which I paid for about 3 to 4 months ) so he can work on my case.

'' The loan servicer continued to make document demands, the legal process continued in "" dual tracking '' fashion ( see attached court docket ) and I was in the process of answering a specific loan servicer document request datedXX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ) when we were informed in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that we had been refused a loan modification and had been conditionally approved for a short sale. ( which we explicitly were not interested in ) In addition while we were being detained chasing down the same documents again for what had to literally be the 7th time, the servicer without cause makes a determination and either kept it to themselves or instructed their attorney, XXXX XXXX, to conceal it. We literally received the loan servicer determination on the day ( 14 days hence from determination ) that our Appeal would be due. On XX/XX/XXXX, the loan servicer 's attorney filed a Motion for Summary Judgement utlizing an Affidavit and Final Judiciary Report constructed on XX/XX/XXXX. After getting caught in their fraud, the attorney withdrew their summary judgment motion in order for the loan servicer to conduct an "" appeal. '' It should be further noted that no such appeal took place. 14 days later, the original determination was "" rubber stamped '' and the attorney refiled the Motion for Summary Judgment. OnXX/XX/XXXX Citi assigned XXXX XXXX as my "" single point of contact throughout my loan modification treatment. It is clear from Citi 's conduct that they never intended to provide a loan modification, that they were at all times "" dual tracking '' this process to lead me to Foreclosure and that various Civil Federal Rule 's have been violated for them to achieve their illicit ends. The reason given for refusing the loan modification was that we were refused "" because we had been modified before. '' What reasonable mind would accept that after 22 months and countless volumes of document demands that the "" reason '' for the loan modification being denied was something that a 4th grader could have determined all those many months ago? In addition to the specific violations of CFR 1024.41 ( f ) ( 2 ), it should be fairly clear to the reasonable minds at the CFPB that Citimortgage is "" thumbing it 's nose '' at CFPB Consent Order 2017-CFPB-0005.",Mortgage,0,0
"I have filed 2 complaints against OCWEN in an attempt to get my mortgage invoices reported correctly. On both occasions, they have done a complete review of my account, concluded that my account is current and I have not missed or made any late payments, cfpb have closed the complaint on the word of OCWEN that the issue have been resolved and then continue to send me bills showing that my account is past due and has an outstanding balance. I'm convinced that OCWEN has the nefarious intention on foreclosing on my mortgage if I am not paying attention, so I am insisting that this complaint not be closed until I have received a bill showing no outstanding amounts and that my mortgage is completely current. I spoke with 2 individuals at OCWEN on XX/XX/XXXX one was the escalation manager and they still insist that I owe OCWEN from XXXX. This statement insinuates that my mortgage is over the 120 days behind at which point they can begin foreclosing against me. 

The two previous complaint numbers are XXXX and XXXX. 

I am attaching the letters sent in answer to these complaints clearly stating that my account is current and am insisting that OCWEN correct my account to show that it is current with XXXX outstanding amounts.

"On XXXX XXXX, 2016 my home was sold unlawfully at a Sheriff 's sale. The foreclosure sale was illegally authorized by Specialized Loan Servicing LLC ( "" SLS '' ) before the loss mitigation process was completed. Employees of SLS have admitted verbally that there is no proof that the foreclosure should have taken place since the loss mitigation process was not completed. I was assigned a single point of contact ( SPOC ) to manage the loss mitigation process since I was unemployed and recently started my own company to earn income to support a loan modification plan. Prior to the sale of the home, SLS assigned a new SPOC, but the home was sold prior to initiating a discussion with this person. I submitted all required information to SLS to support the loss mitigation process and was told that I would be informed of the decision. This was never done. To date, no decision was reached regarding the loss mitigation evaluation process and I told that the loss mitigation request was in review and no decision was made. Prior to the sale of the home, the lender, XXXX, was working with a local law firm to sell the home and kept issuing new documents that the foreclosure sale would occur on a particular date while the customer service division of SLS was working with me on a loss mitigation plan to avoid the foreclosure sale. I believe this process is called "" dual tracking '' and is illegal.",Mortgage,1,1
"I applied to modify my loan on  XXXX   XXXX ,  2017 . I submitt ed a full package of information including the Uniform Borrower As sistance Form and reasons for my need for modification including a severe medical hardship, to the bank. In a matter of a few days they claim to have fully reviewed my file and denied my application on  XXXX   XXXX ,  2017 . They claimed they could not approve me for a modification due the fact they could not lower my payment sufficiently. The bank proposed a higher interest rate at 4 % compared to the 3.5 % interest rate I am paying now and said they could n't lower my interest payment. Additionally rather than extending the time within I could pay off my mortgage, they shortened the total number of mon ths from what the amortization date is. Based on this criteria of a higher mortgage interest rate and shorter time for full payoff of course my monthly payments would increase and this is contradicting to what Nationstar is advertising on their website under help for homeowners. The following was copy  and pasted directly from their website   "" LOAN MODIFICATION If you 're facing long-term hardship, we can see about modifying your loan so it has more manageable terms.
<P/>
While refinancing means replacing your existing loan with a new one, loan modification keeps your existing loan and changes its terms.    <P/> If you qualify for loan modification, we 'll look for a way to reduce your monthly payment. Maybe we 'll be able to lower your interest rate. Or maybe we can extend the loan 's timeframe so we can lower each month 's payment ''",Mortgage,1,0

"My wife and I have been trying to get a short sale approval since XXXX of 2014 for a home we rented out but due to the disrepair the tenants left it in we could not afford to fix it nor could we continue to pay on it as we had another home we were living in and had a child born in XXXX of 2014 in which my wife quit working to take care of. We contacted our mortgage company about it and they sent us paperwork and we had to resubmit it numerous times due to them claiming they did n't receive it or not giving us the proper forms and having to submit more. It took them 5 months to finally approve the process to begin a short sale. However, when we found a buyer, the mortgage company would not contact us to let us know the situation on it and when I or my realtor contacted them they would tell us different things. The buyer backed out of the sale due to the lack of progress from the mortgage company and my realtor took the house off the market until we could find out what was going on with the mortgage company. At that time, the house had been on the market for at least 4 months. A week after that, the mortgage company finally had us sign an Approval to Participate and said that we had to have the house on the market for another 4 months. My realtor found another buyer for the home but now the buyer is looking to back out due to the mortgage company once again not responding to my realtor or myself. Also, the mortgage company keeps refusing to accept documentation from my realtor that would allow the short sale to be approved. I have received several letters informing me that I have a single point of contact but whenever I call they are unavailable and I am told anyone can help me with the situation. I called again today and now am being told only the underwriter can help me but he is also unavailable.

"I changed homeowner insurance companies recently, but before the insurance company contacted my mortgage company XXXX Carrington Mortgage XXXX the mortgage company paid the old insurance company. The old insurance company sent me a refund check for {$1200.00}, the amount it had been paid. To return the full amount XXXX {$1200.00} XXXX to my escrow account I made a regular mortgage of payment of {$420.00} and added the {$1200.00} of the insurance refund to the regular payment. I indicated that the additional {$1200.00} was to go to escrow by using the blank marked escrow, on my payment stub. All this took place during the month of XXXX. The payment was to be the payment due on the first of XXXX. Towards the end of XXXX I checked online to see if the payment had been processed. It had been processed, but incorrectly. The mortgage company had taken the entire amount and put it towards future payments. Thereby, making only a very small amount go to refunding my escrow account. I called their customer service department and tried to work through what had happened and how it would be corrected. I was assured they would correct the problem. I asked to be notified when the problem had been resolved, but was told "" we do not notify anyone in situations like this ''. After arguing with the person for several minutes, and them speaking with their manager, I was told that in this instance they would let me know when the correction had been made. After waiting several days, without being notified, I checked online again. Some changes had been made on the escrow amounts, principal amounts, and interest amounts, but it was all still incorrect. They still had the {$1200.00} spread out like several mortgage payment, and with incorrect amounts. So, I called yet again. This time I spoke with someone named XXXX and explained what was supposed to have happened, and what they did wrong.We determined they still needed to move {$840.00} back from principal and interest payments and into my escrow. I was again assured they would take care of it. I asked again to be notified when the changes were made, and was told the same story as before. After a heated argument I was assured I would be notified when the changes were made. As of today, XXXX/XXXX/2015, they have not corrected the problem. Instead, they have only changed the amounts again. Now the escrow account is owed {$550.00} of the original {$1200.00} that was sent to strictly be placed in escrow. The {$550.00} in question is still listed as addition payments to principal and interest. I was tempted to call yet again, but fear I will only end up with the same results.
